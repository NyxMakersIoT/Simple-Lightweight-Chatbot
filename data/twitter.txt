i know, i know, i'm white. but i don't even hear it. obv it exists. but largely a media/machine concept at this point. to distract
the magic of trump, and i'll admit he's talented, is that he gets ppl to co-sign on heinous stuff under the guise of "america 1st"
i wish their secondary could have been tested by a competent qb

decent warmup, afterwards look at this yugh story!
if you've served as an election judge in the u.s., i need your help for a project. email me here.
you're originally from syracuse? i lived there years ago. moving out was one of the happiest days of my life! :)
out here reppin
damn straight
blood clot in brain: fine now debilitating cough: allergies carried after a collapse: just heat but you can totally trust she's fit to lead!
and that's what they admit! god knows what they are hiding
they need to work something out, this whole situation is retarded.
their biggest fear is user manipulation of certain trophies with the use of mods. dead serious.
the cowboys got the redskins after a monday night loss on a short week. now they get the bears after a monday night loss on a short week
and the bears have gotten pretty beaten up tonight.
i'm going to see if my place offers it but i think they only do regular physical therapy
i used to go to this place in grand concourse and 159 i think, and i did acupuncture there. so good. the asian lady hooked me up

as i've discussed before it's a great example of jumbo sized heart vs. free sample sized brain
not convinced. shouldn't we instead be using prevailing exchange rates for each year?
but that shouldn't impact the share within a given year, right?
you didn't like it? i forgot you wasn't there 🤔
weren't you sleep?
must admit: the eagles look dangerously good on offense and defense.
would be better with tebow tho
jay cutler is just the worst
great, you cursed him
i can see why other people would like the sleekness of it. but i find apple's inconvenience to be...well, inconvenient.
saying people only like the 7/7+ because it's sleek is pretty obtuse. preferring a digital audio source is not a crazy idea

selective outrage by kos. many endorsed them including national pta. you only noted conservatives. strange....
pick a few more notable people then
pray tell what lies were told??
"he'll get the best lawyer" only if his family has the money. trump uses really good ones.

1000s of syrian children like omran have been killed in the war. they aren't skittles. they're children.

when i want my android to change something, someone has written a program for that feature. i could program it if i had the time!

who the chicago tribune reporters picked in this game (h/t , )

most about mexican, blacks what have you got to lose, most about muslims, which wasn't is easier..
what was racist about anything he said?
jimmy fallon thinks its funny that we have a disgusting racist misogynist insane piece of shit running 4 president. ur pathetic
he'll also have hillary on and she's responsible for killing thousands of civilians in drone attacks.
make help the culture of communities.
hillary is winning! why? she puts kids first. she has good ethics. it is also why she is made an object of scorn by some.

media setting up dynamic: trump retreats from birtherism, gets credit for being more responsible, undecideds decide he's more acceptable.
if people aren't allowed to change, then your egregious miscues at nyt disqualify you from commentary.
coming up next hour: house minority leader . tune in 📺
and the reason for this is?
come on now. this should have been a big with fireworks that had an eye on lol
even before then. and real talk i don't care.
why shouldn't american children come first &amp; be the dreamers in america, not foreigners
very good point. its time we paid attention to our native born dreamers. thats trump's main point, america first. please rt

.: trump bringing up obama's birthplace "was not something that he did as a service to the country"
wrong: hillary clinton brought it up...trump went w/it. i bet aft he leaves office we will find out a lot more abt obama
this guy thinks that because journalists disdain donald trump, they are not obligated to cover him fairly.
more than that. thinks americans should not be allowed decide trump should be potus.
robert de niro compares donald trump to 'taxi driver' character: "god help us"
if that's the case. we're in trouble.. hillary is collapsing... who will be the president in november?
i grew up in michigan. all of the dems i know are changing parties &amp; voting trump!!!!!! they want to 🇺🇸
michigan used 2 b a hub of economic activity. hillary's husband created nafta n that started the downtrend nationally
.: trump bringing up obama's birthplace "was not something that he did as a service to the country"
...i don't mean where he was born, but how islam influenced his thinking &amp; loyalties.
trumps economic spiel is not a plan, its a bunch of unattainable goals that would blowup deficit &amp; debt 4 the rch
you don't know what your talking about
seems like a good folo question would be, "mr. trump, why did obama have to prove his citizenship to you?"
good answer: because potus works for people, they are his boss, and can make any demands they deem fit.

ur twitter profile says mom and not worst mom on planet. may wanna switch that.
lol will be pleased :p
who is this sob &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; just blocked me. never even talked him once. so many insecure people
why doesn't trump's wife ever appearance with him? only his daughter. odd.

you know you have a phenomenon when people are thanking you for showing them commercials. what the what.
just in: donald trump likely to address birther issue today
whatever he'd say you'd attack it. if "it was a stupid thing to say &amp;i really regret it"...you'd say he's just being a politician!
trump exposed them all as girlie men.
yess he did.. trump slaughtered the entire old wing of gop. 😳trust the dems are next. they try to fight it but it's inevitable
business or pleasure? that's where i'm frommmm(ish)

i'd play golf with obama and i believe he's a good father. but a disaster as president.
we can agree to disagree on his capabilities, i agree on there are some fumbles. but overall not the worst.

this is horribly wrong. about 6% of the uninsured - ~1.5m adults - earn &gt;400% of the fpl.
ken if that's commonwealth, their &gt;400% fpl no. is weird. census has 20% in'15

yup or have an iq in low double digits

why are millennials so blasé about a possible trump victory? historical ignorance.
yes, plus they are risk takers. have no problem allowing trump to tear america apart assuming it can be easily "fixed."
lame. i'm hoping that they let me get something other than the rose gold that i reserved but i'm not holding my breath.

while i'm not a supporter of abortion by any means, i think in certain places it's needed
lifetime of fighting for progressive causes? like unions, or minimum wages, or welfare? hmm

so the prophet pbuh himself negotiating with the jews that lived at the time, what does that make him? 🤔
such ignorance. appalling that these creatures have the audacity to question people's faith because of a bloody pic.
happy birthday 🎉 have a good one 😊

they actually pay more than so strange explanation
yes, very odd 🤔

trump still creates loophole that goes beyond ryan plan to cut rates on biz income to 15%, letting trump pay lower rate than many families.
twenty four hours later, i still stand by this prebuttal tweet 👇
yes "of the two humans who can be physically elected president, vote for the one you like better" is real radical.
right and they don't have to earn that. they just stand around like a show horse
the sleeping giant has awakened ! blacks are not voting for hillary !
rightly so..dems just want the vote.look at chicag.etc. trump is a negotiator who wins and gets things done

both options! lots of blame to go around.
it is the biggest give away though. with a heft portion mandated to be spent on us weapons - how nice 😏 more blood👐

hormoneless tweeting endocrinology bites behind unseen curves i am truly on the fence today. menopause w/ no ovaries
no one told me there would be days like this. the endo says 'catastrophic' as they can't prescribe what's gone 4now
to point out where we are this am. with bated breath, we're waiting for someone to confirm they think is an actual us citizen.
you media folks have given trump such a low bar and pass and gone out the way to damage hrc. please don't act concerned now.
no. he clearly is doing this for himself. his entire manner in this race should make this fully obvious to you.
what is obvious to me is that he has the characteristics of a strong leader n part of that is having a strong sense of self.
she is not worthy of our votes sir.to many lies told .trump may not be the best pick but he sure knows how to reach us.
with lies. read politicususa or politifact to know what's true &amp; what isn't. you owe it to yourself &amp; america.

so, friends of privilege (and this is intersectional, you can have non black privilege w/o white privilege, male but not able-bodied, etc.)
donald trump has by turns praised and vilified the fed chair, janet yellen, and the fed’s interest-rate policies.
the trump crash is coming. voodoo economics, deficit spending, drastic spending cuts will spur the sell off. make america kansas!
krauthammer: 'this is an election about nothing'
kraut is a has been totally wrong since beginning
a simple regression method adjusting for a handful of demographics isn't going to fix this problem
replace insurance status with education or income and you get the same flawed, pointless study who funded this, and why?
so you just say stuff and it's the media that's corrupt?
provides the understandable defense of an anachronistic medium on its last legs.

appreciate it! my client needs someone on-site for this. stay in touch though.
ok. thanks for your reply.
johnson should be allowed in the debates if for no other reason than to set up a dynamic of two adults vs. one big fat baby.
more importantly: it sets up the dynamic of johnson as clinton's *true* opponent, leaving trump's third wheel in the dust.
really ? a person who refuses press conferences and won't answer tough questions demanding answers ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

hey now phl is my home airport. im smart enough that i would never go near it. it isn't a wretched hive. it's just wretched
but now mr birther is recanting- proving he will say anything. will his supporters notice or care about this major flip flop?
nope. and the perfidy of the news media is already baked in.
i wonder where donald jr 1st heard the reference "warming up the gas chamber" bc i see it often in tweets to me from trump supporters
what is worse, the holocaust reference itself or that he thinks that the gas chambers were warmed up.
really ? a person who refuses press conferences and won't answer tough questions demanding answers ? 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

samuel do u know anything about what hes suggesting? because if udid uwould not that is not so
he's proposing a repeat of g.w. bush recession. huge tax &amp; spending cuts that will cause consumers, businesses to pull back.

yeah that’s the only thing i was worried how bad it would look if the black scratches.

somebody stop the tilt-a-whirl ride that is 2016 america. i'm nauseated and want off.
i'm just hoping the ride is slowing down rather than speeding up for 2017.
and what was that metal clip that fell out of her trousers?
what are you talking about?
sure nancy, while illegals flow in and murder. pelosi suggests gun control vote could 'save 90 lives' - breitbart
sure. and leave americans with no defense against the horde of criminals that are invading us.
replace insurance status with education or income and you get the same flawed, pointless study who funded this, and why?
well, here's a hint. "medicaid isn't good enough, we need coverage from private, for-profit insurance companies!"
ha! thanks, leland! now the fun begins - , , and iphone 7!
dude, you totally rocked it! live tv ain't easy, especially an extended segment! great job!
he's going to stand up there and demand hillary apologize for it. media will protect his lies.
if he does the campaign needs to come back hard on him

(2) has not paid 1000s of employees what they were owed and lied to ppl about trump university. he's the worst.
imagine what he will do to the white house if he wins. what country would he sells it to
anything that limits your expression is ungodly. period.
religion is an ungodly, man-made beast. religion divides so many. god would never.

msm is being suckered into chasing birther stories. force trump to respond to questions he cant answer rather than those he won't answer
if you were on the ticket, with the exception of a few nba team loyalists, we might have approached a unanimous, potus landslide.

hrc supports monsanto.☠💰
i truly truly feel bad for you bills fans you guys can't catch a break.
don't feel bad for us. we chose to wade in this mess.
tip for my media friends: cover his press conference today and don't mention it was at his new hotel in dc. watch the infantile fury.
thought he doesn't care about his business. using campaign to promote. insane.
why? most voters are idiots and he knows he can run you around breathlessly reporting on every dump he takes.
you went further out on the limb last week, and now he's sawing it off behind you. that's the reason for this tweet.
maybe he hasn't insulted you directly, but that shouldn't let him off the hook. and in fact, he has attacked women.
you're right, he hasn't insulted me directly but his missteps r more due to his political incorrectness not insincerity.
trump jr. insists his father denounced birtherism despite recent dodge
fruit doesn't fall from the tree!' another con learned from his father !
don't encourage my bad decision making
won't encourage but ill support it 🤘🏼
congrats! but now you need a new nemesis bird according to
don't worry, i'm on it: kentucky warbler.
its not about money, obama does not get extra cash for doing what he does, the system itself is fucked.
this system is made up of people. he bears responsibility.
that's terrible! i learned you have to deal with it and not ignore it,it's stressful but it won't go away on its own
good morning beautiful
just a simple advice. go to their website and use them, decide and then again use whichever you like.
thanks. used both but still cant decide
trump can make fun of the injury that took sight in my eye-i've dealt with tougher opponents. with my good eye, i see trump is a con-artist.
please read.
your bond and loyalty with your brothers should never be broken over a dollar bill... ghost
i agree bro

clinton needs her base to turn out, so what does she do? talk to republicans. unreal. she's a train wreck. her campaign is pathetic.
republicans who've hated her for 25 years are suddenly going to vote for her. keep blaming bernie ffs! cannot wait for elex to end!

trump teases "big announcement" on obama citizenship today at opening of dc hotel:
i don't give a rat's patootie what thinks of citizenship now or back when he started this ridiculous bs
here's how the chevy bolt really compares to tesla
except tesla model 3 will never hit peak production and everyone knows it. musk lies.
this was trump's response when asked how he plans to replace obamacare unfu*^%#%believable
it's the spastic narcissist version of "the dog ate my healthcare plan."
you still got like 2 weeks. i still hope i win meet and greet tickets with rihanna, then you can have my regular one. 😂

also the wrong rookie qb in 2015. the truth shall emerge this season, oh roberty bob.
you didn't like either of them. but i'll take my chances. both are going to be great.
just in: pelosi responds to trump's "birther" remarks: "the damage is done"
exactly, u can't backtrack this
im disappointed n i voted4 him&amp; felt that he just rolled over after rigged the election
bsanders has been in politics a long time and knows what a trump admin would look like. period.
definitely would like to but i have a few things that need to be committed to first. follow up in a week or two?
sounds great greg, chat soon!

that new sports car you bought should help now shouldn't it ? fcuk that communism sh1t eh bern?
well, here's a hint. "medicaid isn't good enough, we need coverage from private, for-profit insurance companies!"
thanks for the "news" on health insurance from a non-profit associated with a giant insurance provider
im disappointed n i voted4 him&amp; felt that he just rolled over after rigged the election
i know that bsanders will hold hrc accountable everyday. we have the vote the greater good.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
they want to believe a narrative so badly,it doesnt matter the words are empty-only that theyre said
because bernie hasn't done what he said he'd do, and the berniebots are continuing to trash hillary.
i am curious why you are not attacking gary johnson, the candidate youth say they will vote for?
shit to personal ... and feminine
it's as personal as you make it &amp; negative, i know tons of dude with it and they don't portray as feminine
hugs and thanks
thank you. have a great weekend :-)
really hope we don't have to put up with these guys at the . and here's why -&gt;
couldn't agree more. they seem to be having a good time but spoil it for others.

you guys too. wish you were on weekends too but you need time off also.
ukrainian moonshuners v. 1.0

call your publicist.
then call your mom, it's that kind of day.
at least it's friday!
then i got pulled over while texting my parents about the accident!!
wow liberals are insane and kinda creepy
you think that's insane &amp; creepy? man, what do you think of trump mocking the disabled and saying he'd date his daughter?
it's crazy cause last week before the jets played i needed a rb and he asked me if i wanted him and i said no it's ok 😩😩😩😩
omg!!! 😂😂😂😂 maybe better off. don't want to change the good karma right now.
how we getting out there?
lmaooooo , i don't mind driving but i don't have that much space
that is what we tell you guys, to not hurt feelings. 😜
that's hilarious !
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
psychologically,the tactics they're using are powerful. hillary is so debilitated she's only a prop
how we getting out there?
we gonna have to take a few cars
he said he don't see color or race either.
anyone can have straight hair. straight hair is all genetics. you can't appropriate genetics. fuck outta here.
dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?
do your jobs and point out that he is lying might be a place to start.
trump talking up medicaid as a means of replacing some of obamacare. i can’t imagine his party embracing this.
the problem is you sam! you continue to divide america rather than solutions &amp; viable compromises.
traitors oo! the trump is needed for balance. apparently hilary has pneumonia! are there any talks of conceding?
balance? ha! u want a bigot for balance😂killing me dude!hillary ain't going nowhere! fyi not that i like that female.
so i think it's safe to say that walk off home run and the announcement of is the definition of a exceptional thursday.
also, i think it must be said that my next hat in my collection should be pink.
democrats don't think so, they can't understand intelligent speech. they only understand lying and cheating.
but it doesn't matter.make her look good when she is seen and have the right things said on tv &amp; sm
saw this and it strikes me as exactly the type of thing people are mad about when they say there's false equivalency
this type of vapid chatter is really confined to cable filling hours. lots of other media doing strong, critical coverage of born candidates
i'm totally happy to. the bernie brigade seems to disagree.
maybe, just maybe could try disdaining youth from voting gary johnson, the actual threat.
i'm so hesitant on tickets cuz idk if genbeauty is gonna be too much
i always pick one makeup showcase a year like i can't do imats and the makeup show its too much 😩

this is the stupidest thing i have ever heard. and why is it only the left keeps bringing racists up?
when you deny the legitimacy of the first black president, it does not look like an accident--only a dog whistle
i disagree that this is brilliant. she is showing her hand for debate. their campaign is a .
i don't think she'll do the debates
she's a corrupt liar. if you're so easily taken in by a slogan then you deserve her.
america doesn't deserve a traitor like trump who loves dictators &amp; lies habitually. politicususa
boys round here or something else?
just the crowd ...
it seems that the smurfs might have a new slur for us? rad bulls/rad birds? i mean, ok, sure

don't turn to the dave barry's and matt lauers of the world looking for substantive election coverage
burger time!
how was it??
the only way it isn't if it is due to aspiration and that means parkinsons. they are stuck.

you can bet it wont be his blood.
people that wear open toed sandals/flip flops to the airport are a different breed of ew
where r u going?
"guarantees a whole lot of follow up" is pretty optimistic based on what we've seen the last few months
trump has has so much bad press, but i could see an argument for it being more shallow.
ok but like imagine having ur right foot in gakus ass and the other foot in yamatos so its like yamato and gaku are ur shoes and u walk,
i'm the person who has my foot shoved up gaku's ass
again? trouble for the congress in arunachal, 44 mlas led by pema khandu merge with the people's party
stopped watching politics.. no comment..
in my opinion he or hillary are not the greater good anymore. as a democrat i cant do that
we need you to vote for hrc and hold her and your local elected officials accountable.
s/o to you guys for using my topic on today's posted show, and a huge thank you!!! and always, go steelers!!
great question! keep em coming 👊🏻👊🏻

thank you 🤗
as med records aren't a matter of course for potus campaigns-who knows how many took blood thinners?
and trump didn't show med report from a reputable doctor. his dr. settled malpractice suit.

trump teases "big announcement" on obama citizenship today at opening of dc hotel:
screw trump and his announcement.
"you can let me catch these 💤 or you can catch these 👊🏾... what it's gone be?!?!" 😂😂😂
fuck all that i just snap on them thru text have them looking at they phones confused.
it was her hustle. she had a full time job that paid well she said
she could have gotten a part time job at macy's
the words "pony roll" verbally matched with the protein shake image inside my brain.
what is.....a pony roll
stop checking for me and worry about your mf self bitch!
lol obsessed ctfu its ridiculous how much u talk but never say shiy to chelse. bitch ur pathetic
and as a result of birtherism, 40% of trump supporters believe obama was not born in the u.s.
more likely as a result of bigotry and/or poor education
what's new on heinz field menu? franco's sausages, $15 fries, pork on pork sandwich

you listened to schmilco yet?
about 5 times since yesterday hahah. i like it a lot.
what did i say the other day about how the left needs more crackpots in order to catch up w/ rw nuts? found one
history: 9/11: 3,000 dead. iraq: 4,500+ dead, katrina fiasco, 2007 recession. trump advised by same conservative ideologues.
aww...wish i could,especially with paddles standing by 😁 sure you'll do great!👊🏻 up for a hike tho?
well, figured since he "conned" me into it, he could save me when i pass out! he is a dr. afterall!
no. worth checking out?

the not so veiled threat embedded in this section of brooks' column is chilling: "get in line or be hung out to dry"
i was hoping this was satire when i started it
it's disingenuous as is her entire campaign. mook is a bumbling idiot.
disingenuous are the clinton lives. it is her turn to be a used meat puppet
this lady just called to check in right now???? like check in is at 3 lady
must be something going around today people are crazy this morning 🙈
enjoy alone shey 😂 next time put me in your hand luggage
lool pele! a holiday was so needed 😩 next time i'll smuggle you
trump has now shot ahead in latest poll by 8 points over clinton in swingstate iowa. is everyone sending hillary's campaign some ideas?

this is the reason why mat lauer went hard on her and this is the reason would you still vote
wow so you really want to vote for hillary after all this.. do you guys have a soul left!!
imo larger european cage standards where chicken can move around spread wings etc is better then cage free.
my birds roam fields all day and go inside at night
to attack is to legitimize him. that's worse than clinton or trump to all the party leaders.
winning 26% of the youth vote has already legitimized gary johnson.

again, birtherism isnt factual error. it's conscious racist agitation. you don't skate on that history by dropping the narrow factual claim.
will be interesting to see who lets him off the hook easy and who sees the tactics for what they are.

if my child can competently play the likes of dominion and takenoko, is he ready for terraforming mars?
terraforming mars is ages 12+, but i always think that, for smart "gamer kids", you can subtract 2 years.
i mean, trump *should* disavow it, of course. but it's not like all is instantly forgotten once he says the words.
whats trump expect obama to say "thanks"?
"i stand before you today to tell you, that blogger was wrong, dammit."
"i want to use 45 minutes of this hour to tell you exactly why. the last 15 minutes will be appropriative call and response."
why does it have to be liek this when it can be like this gaku ahs a wide assho
if his asshole is wide enough surely it can fit my smallass foot inside

damn. didn't realize it's that serious! hespect.
totally worth it. there are other people out here with me talking. hyped
sadly, the public thinks that 2 stories or people reported on together means they are equivalent. :(
trump is in a class by himself, and it is a failing class of lies, hate, corruption, &amp; shady deals
wake on lift ftl
i like it, actually. on the other hand, i’d like to remove that “apps” button from messages.

excellent on why trump is making a race of it: the race is not about government, it's about the nation.
don't you have any qualms about touting family members without disclosure?
the only purpose for allowing people to vote without id is to make it easier to commit election fraud🙄

donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
depending on how question is phrased is key: ask "do you really think trump's a bigot or is that a media invention" &amp; c what u get
: btw, your video ads automatically play, which it makes it impossible to start watch any articles you post with videos.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
he'll get credit for "putting the issue behind him." meanwhile will hillary even try to give a reason to be for her?
be for hillary because she's sure obama was born in the usa! usa has no other problems, so that's that!
reporters today covering trump don't forget to ask him why he questioned potus' admittance to harvard as well.
he said he is going to blame this on hrc today. said this on fox business this morning.
i bought a frozen pizza. good night.

trump campaign praises trump for forcing first black president to produce his birth certificate to prove he's legit
. trump’s racist father obviously passed his hate and rhetoric to little donald. time the media challenges fred's life.
i want no parts of anyone, much less a woman, who can drink everclear straight from the bottle. they clearly reckless and dangerous.

hahahahaha i hate children
does anyone know what this ride or rally was last night?
the protest ride you saw was this: too many 🚶‍♀️ &amp; 🚴‍♀️ deaths on our streets, too little action.
donald trump jr. on "gas chamber" remarks: "poor choice of words" but "i wasn't talking about the holocaust:"
like father like son!
how can you be so insensitive? police are shooting harambe's family down in the street and all you can think about is hurting joy
all your hate, anger, name calling, hollering about walls (which ain't getng bilt btw) beatng flks up at ur ralies ain't chngng

do i want to go and find out?
yes you should watch it. a milestone in the normalization of racism, xenophobia, hatred…
nope. it's not a huge deal but i use playlists to manage what i sync with each of my devices, so it's annoying.
wait just kidding it lost my whole library, not just playlists. i have it, but i need to reimport which is annoying on many levels.

says the man without 5 homeless shelters in one area 🤔🤔🤔
when another opened in my district this year, i supported despite some loud early voices of opposition.
no, didn’t “misstate key facts,” he straight out told bald faced lies about rev. faith green timmons,...
a disgrace on the pastors part! he was respectful and attacked nobody. you want to stay depressed vote dem.
have you looked at hillary lately?
i have seen her but i am not a doctor and wouldn't go to one who makes patently false ridiculous claims in writing
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you have done nothing but lie about all 6 months - you have nothing to run on, but lies for the gop !!!
yeah i cant wait!
me either.. looking forward to the tailgate.. i'm stoked.. n seeing a bunch of y'all is going to be great
we're looking for a house to rent in the winter n just found one thts $900 for a month rental this is gonna b a disaster
ooo, where, trying to do somethi g similar.
:( so long . you've been good to me.
lots of us use outlook here. it's a great app.
trump won't fully disavow his birther crap because too many of his followers really believe obama wasn't born in u.s.
i felt true shame that president obama felt the need to even react to this crap. i would've told them all to go to hell!
lmao why they on my dick lmfaoooo
they love you lmao
flint pastor: trump started to go beyond planned talking points
but if hillary had done that, she would have been freely allowed to speak. silencing a potus candidate is un-american!
yeah he should have made him open a pre-opened pickle jar instead.
sounds like it would fit in with trump's skill set
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- try to defend the 105k slimey ass muslims that pres oslimey wants to bring in next month. bullshit - we can't afford them

donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
trump's talking abt it b/c media is. loudmouth matthews using it to get ratings as he did w/abortion. media demeans the nation.

flint pastor: trump started to go beyond planned talking points
black voters want to learn about candidates, not have the facts hidden from them! like all voters! censorship is evil!
i will be when i'm watching it though!
cats lost the hurling so who knows maybe the dubs will lose..
: thinks he looks how old?
this just proves how confident he is, young mind, feeling good, great stamina, non-stop blue color candidate!
i agree. it's a challenge but there are a lot of educators actively working against that in their classrooms. that's hope.
absolutely - definitely need and continue to need people like you fighting the good fight 🙌🏽
and what is a bar of soap going to do for you without a wash cloth? like a hammer without nails...or something

majority of community ultimately supportive, and welcomed the new residents.
these drawings are so interesting. love them. they tell a story in itself.
thanks they are from each chapter page😊
i assume the files are still there? sounds like a corrupt library file (or it lost track of it somehow). you should be able to....
yeah, files still there. but most recent itunes library.itl is from 2011. :/
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- what happened to the religion of peace - islam beheaded a 4 yr old girl and made her mom hold her. bullshit - fuck muslims
firefighter culture is weird. big differences when you move from the fire scene to a classroom.
you'd think most classrooms are churches with how much folks speak up in them. sure, no one wants to be the guy delaying class constantly...
donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
media makes the news, not politicians. politicians just say things. media turns it into news. it's flogging birther issue
mere weeks away from potential white nationalist president and here's the scene at nbc
where was matt lauer?

what a treat! thank you.
people wanted to shit on bowles, but he's really something special. coached an excellent game looking down the barrel of 0-2.
losing to this goon 3 times in a row, would’ve been the first time i questioned bowles. i think we got something here with him
today already fuckin sucks
what's wrong
kudos to pastor faith green timmons - the msm should take serious notes for handling trump
how about taking notes on how he showed he respect and handled her ass
new research: the united states is "failing the test of competitiveness" thanks to a broken political system
: it's we the people who elect crazies.
i think i just spotted banksy and his disguise was terrible.

new gallery with my favourite pictures from on my website.

you'd think most classrooms are churches with how much folks speak up in them. sure, no one wants to be the guy delaying class constantly...
but if the instructor asks a question- protip: you're supposed to speak up. share. "what is your air management policy? do you practice it?"
that's bullshit about teachers. my mother taught high school and proud union member. her students loved her.
instead of individuals i am talking about the system. finding the teacher who can change lives is rare. it shouldn't be.
"win a $250 gift card to saks". and use it on? a pack of gum? 😂

if she doesn't do debates she loses election. it will be the final nail in her coffin.
i'm not sure i agree.remember,they only need plausible deniability.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
- you cannot defend this shit any more. you have broken more laws than any other woman on earth !!!!
if you want to see what is wrong with media coverage of this campaign look at the wall to wall on trump's birther history.
trump will spin this as his campaign has already started to dump stuff on clinton. lies dragged behind lies. which leads me to a question ..
i didn't realize you had that low of an opinion about teachers.
i have a very high opinion of the power of the great teacher. it is a miracle how they can change lives.
we do not allow those kinds of ads. do yo recall which ad it was on the blog?
also do you recall if it was desktop or mobile?
oh i know i agree, i was just saying going forward as coquelin has become a liability.
he was always a liability fwd..until this season, he sat back. aw seems to want him in a pressing role, we don't move togthr
hey, l.i.! join brian + 9/19 ahead of the first trump/clinton debate:

is dry shampoo a good or bad thing? cause if i shower in the morning i tend to feel sick afterwards and want to avoid that if i can.

who loves this lady?
me! i love her.
donald trump on birther issue: "i'm going to make a big announcement on it today"
i honestly think trump doesn't even notice the race of the person he's talking to...yes, that's what i really think frm watching him
if it's coming from a business, it's always "too good to be true" mike. short run vs long run.
yeah, you're right. was just thinking even with costing a little more, easing upgrade process would be worth it...
weird--why did barackobama sr. fail to list as his son in his 1961 ins application?

we are better when we keep our shape as with xhaka and santi we have the ability to play quick passes to counter.
yeah i think we agree. i just hope aw gets better tactically. he's causing great imbalance in the side.
trump will spin this as his campaign has already started to dump stuff on clinton. lies dragged behind lies. which leads me to a question ..
how is this news? well, it isn't. thank you news media. if you think the war in iraq destabilized the middle east wait until trump weighs in

yes black ppl, keep voting dem; stay stupid. enjoy the lies and ruined cities.
or you, the outright bigotry from the gop
no, the plan is to stop us from becoming a minority. you speak of it as if it were written in stone. but we can stop it.
ur an idiot. an idiot drowning in denial. rational white folks realize it ain't the end of the world. so enlighten me how are --
a downside of twitter is that i have a character limit and can't point out all the factually incorrect things here:
maybe donald trump is rich on money but the sad fool is poor on everything else his kids follow
same!!!!!!!!!! you coming to this?
of course its my last webster night before i move!

one thing that distinguishes mode media from other silicon valley failures is that people are not pretending to grieve for mode.
well, they owe us all money.
if trump is about to do what i think he's about to do, i think it's going to backfire on him quite badly.
if his story is "hillary invented birtherism and i'm the one who debunked it," that's an obvious lie, not unusual for trump. but.
i'll go out of my way to get away from whatever i'm doing just so i can tap out a rhythm pattern or something

no, he didn't. please, enlighten me on that one.
if his story is "hillary invented birtherism and i'm the one who debunked it," that's an obvious lie, not unusual for trump. but.
it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.
you just parrot what the ny times tells you to say
i read books, magazines and newspapers, including the wsj. you should try it sometime.

it's not a lie about the terms of some business deal. it's about what he's done in our faces for years, what made him politically prominent.
it is a lie that -- maybe -- even some voters who don't realize trump has been lying to them all the time will know is a lie.
obama approved $4.6m to refugees for emotional support, “they have it tough”

ahhh have a safe and fun trip :)
it is a lie that -- maybe -- even some voters who don't realize trump has been lying to them all the time will know is a lie.
not just those who know trump was wrong about this. also ones who were buying into it when trump pushed this theory past 2011.
but that has connotations

trump is trying to rewrite his history of birtherism. this is what really happened.
trump wins best at obfuscating award! congrats to him!
not just those who know trump was wrong about this. also ones who were buying into it when trump pushed this theory past 2011.
to borrow a phrase from a prominent man, "how stupid are the people of this country?" he's finally underestimating the public intelligence.
's decision (which audubon supports) was more nuanced and less cynical than "appeasement"
i'd argue the immense political pressure brought to bear was a major factor in outcome.
where were they?

i don't understand how trump's campaign isn't in the trash can with everything he says and does.

probably to collect his payment from hrc for supporting her
ummm i am an investor so i view everything tht adds value like an investment,so yes there is a difference from a conventional user
. "i view everything tht adds value like an investment" then you know fiat currency isn't a sound investment. neither is
today would be a good day for to release his tax returns.
yesterday was a good day for trump to release tax returns. duh!
the only fantasy here is that you guys think that will say no to 3/4 billion

"when will he stop this ugliness?": clinton blasts trump’s refusal to say obama was born in u.s.
obama refused to say he was born in us in 91. it was not a "mistake".
he's on the roster under reserve/suspended by commissioner
in other words he's done as a new york giant
reporter aboard the press plane says this is "yet another example of trump's total mistreatment of the press"
he learned that from the clintons
record of the year? might have it.
why, thank you very much! ☺️

i hear the bar has some very pricey drinks.
great episode! i wanted to check the blog post that you mention at 7:10. could you post a link?

the point is if we engage publicly but not denounce what's happening, then silence is compliance. (3/3)

deadass bro that nigga really living life lol he's lit
trump basically can't lose here. he either "bravely defies political correctness," he "moderates," he lectures the press or blames it on hrc
trump's real safety net: huge numbers of racist voters.
i want to visit canada now..

i'm so sorry.
have you ever realized your outfit was a mistake less than an hour after you got to work and then you just had to deal with it all day
i've realized things are see-through before and put a sweatshirt on about 5 min after getting to the office.
paid for my brother's bakra at eidhi this year since he was out of town. now he's demanding 'proof of purchase' before reimbursing me 🖕🏼
lol, i can't picture someone having a receipt for a bakra. hahaha
i thought the ifixit tear down showed that there was a sound chamber and mic by the other grill? (see step 7). or am i confused?
maybe i read it wrong but that grill is not the second speaker, the second speaker is at the top. might be a mic tho
i'm here for this

update: no reservations for watches but there will be some. definitely seems limited.
polls have shown him repeatedly to take more from hrc than trump. anecdotally i know many millennials that fit this
johnson's votes have come mostly at expenses of gop. they are mostly the "galt-right"

why are people suddenly realizing that the "tonight show" is not and has never been a place for "hard hitting" interviews?
you obviously missed the episode where fallon pressed xi jinping on his south china sea policies
birtherism was never misunderstanding. it was tool trump used to build his rep with white supremacists via
was he really that strategic about it back then?
easy way out would be to make one in python
i put a significant python system into production at a prev job, so that would be cheating.
a pass? my thread is littered w/stupid threats because pushing on trump for playing with such an ugly topic
let us not forget the clintons: " a few years ago, he'd be "carrying our bags!" 👳
you have already lost even if he wins every round he won't get a decision. sorry
sad but true. look at the cotto cards, even khan before the ko. lol even the lara fight.

you deff gave him the 😏i got you look and he said miss v respect 😏

started reading old fb messages and got to 2009. hey bradley, joke's on you. how's life in your mom's basement?
oh hey bradley
the crooked media is getting there due. trump pence fills stadiums hillary and ho that guy can't fill half a hs gym. lol
you mentioned the first amendment in your tweet. this has nothing to do with the press not getting to the venue on time.
well i want just the aluminum one. i'm still not in line. is it worth getting there now? never wanted smthg this early before
honestly not too sure but i’d imagine the aluminum are the most available. especially if you’re flexible about band colors. 😉
i'm just still gutted we need a visa for the us.
at least they are 10 year multi entry four tourist and business...

if you don't think the guy who pushed for the sammy deal and brought us the dougs isn't responsible, i don't know what to say
a word about anti-blackness &amp; school law enforcement. the term "police state" is redundant; you have no indissoluble rights, period.
the "rule of law" is pure ideological abstraction from ownership. even schools embody a physical fight for who owns the law and who obeys.
donald trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
just like all other men
pretty sure soundcloud notified me about a 2nd side remix from an artist i don’t follow

hillary clinton: “barack obama was born in america... and donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.”

btw i am really enjoying these as a rorschach test based on who is requesting which pin.
okay okay one more thing. there has been a lot of tweet and delete by people who say something and get embarrassed by getting called out.
this is why people save the receipts. this is also why so many people of privilege resent the discussion, or decide to "stay out of it."
trump said in 2011 he’d release taxes if obama releases long form birth certificate. now that he considers the issue solved…taxes?

that fits the conventional narrative around conservation, but the existing plans are hardly a "dream verdict" for industry.
conventional narrative, in this case, equals reality. constant chipping away at sage grouse conservation is the strategy.
also, congrats to - it’s easy for contributors to just taper off, and you never see them again. saying “it’s time” takes gusto.

this is why people save the receipts. this is also why so many people of privilege resent the discussion, or decide to "stay out of it."
not risking embarrassment is more important than dismantling privilege, &amp; erasing evidence of wrongdoing is easier than a sincere apology.
today's top news story, according to america's most widely read news source:

dragging the press to your new hotel to update us on a mistruth you tell about the president...what's press's obligation here?

...wrestling wealthy white males in business suits to the ground, pointing guns into their shiny bmws,shooting them to death at will...
purely coincidence. purely.

if "not warranted" decision keeps stakeholders at the table, includes strong grouse plans &amp; avoids esa backlash, that's a win
i think this "esa backlash" concern that seems so in fashion among conservationists is a major strategic error.
how many iphones have you ever owned
7: 3gs, 4s, 5s, 6, replacement 6 for broken mute switch, 6s+, 7+.

learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
i don't believe dena ever took a leave of absence. she came back to stop whatever she didn't approve of.
dena's so called leave of absence was in august, meaning 6 months of reboot was her writing. now she's trying to shirk responsibility.

then being exonerated...day after day. you can't, it's unthinkable.daily reality for black youth is literally unimaginable to white folks...
...in the paradigm in which hoodies are red herrings to homogenize black bodies with criminality but white hoods and badges aren't.
it does, fuckwad. when someone lies you should tell your readers.
i read the article to ultimately come out agreeing with you.
learning to apologize is important not only because you can then stay in the space and be a true ally (and...isn't that what you want?)--
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
work from home also exists, she expect us to believe she didnt skype in lol
lol. she is clearly delusional. unprofessional too, blaming her fellow writer and thinking she alone knows what's good.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.

i know what trending is. i was referring to facebook, which is america's most widely read news source.
yeah, just don’t think it’s fair for journos to keep equating trending’s influence to the news feed.

line 30 deep at the store in austin. even with less than impressive iphone there is a lot of pent up demand on the 2 year cycle
personally i might upgrade, my expectation was low to begin and think they surpassed it
if trump owns it he will likely try to cast himself as helping country resolve a real issue.
he already did this in his campaign statement - it's an absolute outrage! i sure hope this energizes hrc's base to vote.
i’m ok with that, too. but my list doesn’t start with russ.
i kind of agree. i just rather get rid of anyone associated with putting together any roster from 2000-2014
perhaps calling black youth "super predators" wasn't a great idea.
no it wasnt !!!! hoping the black community's have realized clinton will do nothing for you but take your vote :(
and also, because if you stick around, you learn from your gaffe. why is that important? because if, not you'll gaffe again.
when you gaffe again, you alienate more people. receipts pile up. if not on twitter, irl. rumors spread. word gets around.
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
but, but, he is the president, his home country could not be kenya. she mis-spoke, yea right.
i'm noticing now that i can go long periods of time without the tv on, which prior would be on as long as i was home either stream or cable
not that i paid attention to it the entire time - i certainly couldn't but there used to be something about the constant noise that i needed
no. definitely not overrated. top-6 in three straight years despite topping 140 tgts once. one injury.
but how far off was he from julio/ab/obj in points? i have to look more into it. but i doubt it's close

it's helped me with my time management and helped me be more productive - i'm also more serene whereas i was not a morning person, before.
finding a routine that works for you can certainly be beneficial especially if you're home a lot, sick/depressed etc.

well i have that regardless

this dc event was slated to be a news conference, per 2 sources. but now it's unclear. one source on trump taking qs: "if he feels like it."
the dear leader answers to no one

now people of privilege, this won't hurt your career. at least not yet. you know what it does hurt? your peers. young writers. other people.
i was prepared to vote independent if it was bernie but with all the bashing and thinking trump kids could run america!
never a more important time to vote. 🇺🇸
i encourage you to create a routine for yourself (try) if you have none and reward yourself as often as you can with it.
even if it's stopping to make your own coffee at home because you know you'll get it just right or reading a few pages in the morning.
and also factually inaccurate
that too. i mean i get embellishment. i loved the social network, but it seemed inappropriate here
i have a mini-series vacation coming up next week. birthday on thursday so i took that day and friday off.
stupid autocorrect. not mini-series. had that makes me😠😠😠. grin

sometimes it says the weirdest stuff though:
at least the bubble has burst now so i can move on?! looking for a bright side! x
yay! that feeling is the best. the living back with the parents thing killed me the most haha

mr trump has to put birther issue to bed right now. it's all about getting people jobs and quality of life.
yes joe, he must otherwise, he will give more life to the hillary campaign again. we need him focused

bruh it was my second time, 7 bones.
did you feel the bern on ?
. but. fair question i listen and also watch. and comprehend. before i reply answer yes
fair point &amp; one i have made countless times when talking about trending. not a reason to excuse fb's handling of it, though.
not speaking of you specifically, your tweet just made me think about it. trending is a mess.
i like gauges and eyebrow piercings. shit.
too bad if i dated someone like that my mom would have a heart attack.
ah see i think i suck worse than anyone
well then you'd be pleasantly surprised when someone asked a question
i can't tell if he's crying or is sick or something. 😭
lmao i keep looking over to see if he's crying or not but i can't tell 😂
lol i'm glad i have decker passed on forte cuz he didn't do shit for me last year grabbed elliott and gurley instead
gurley fucked you over last game lol
even if it's stopping to make your own coffee at home because you know you'll get it just right or reading a few pages in the morning.
allotting time for a nice bath once a week. whatever it is - allow yourself little luxuries - make time for yourself.
question of the day: is trump about to ruin what is otherwise a good week for him with birther madness? or will he finally put it to bed?
the former.
hillary wants you to be a mindless dolt. is that better?
u believe in the boogeyman. and easily duped into buying things u don't need. that's who he is! i'm notahilaryfan
been doing the show on for 5 years. celebrating 2nite!
woahhh 5 years 😱

i have a good feeling that will go to town on this.
at least the bubble has burst now so i can move on?! looking for a bright side! x
there's totally a bright side. my ex husband cheated &amp; left &amp; dumped me to my parents house on xmas eve..i'm so much..
piers have morals lol oh don't make me laugh, piers just wants an invite to the white house if his buddy gets in
there is clearly an incentive waiting for him if that douchebag gets elected.

it was a special event...
by "skillfully", you mean he should lie about what he's been saying for 5yrs? and you claim to love the truth. mcheew!
do not conclude for me, u are not the holy spirit that knows what is on my mind. skillfully means a lot of things.
wait let me get this straight. y'all forced yourselves to watch *jimmy fallon* interview *trump* okaaaay
another reason to hate jimmy fallon

now people of privilege, this won't hurt your career. at least not yet. you know what it does hurt? your peers. young writers. other people.
so like i said, learn. learn to apologize. own your wrongness in the space. clean your mess and stick around.

i was going to recommend dan mall but he is doing apprenticeships and that doesnt sound like what you’re getting at.
no, that's super-helpful. i'm coming into this without any knowledge. maybe it is part-apprenticeship for some?
for sure! maybe the 20th? cause that's when we get payed lol
mm maybe that could work
at least the bubble has burst now so i can move on?! looking for a bright side! x

ugh i had quit my job that same day this happened so i feel you!
digby likes to address sadness with face licks, which is nice in theory but also kinda gross
i cannot contain my feelings about this. you can't be down looking at that face.
feels like it's just too soon for a movie about that disaster
are you talking about america or deepwater horizon?
our road is blocked. this truck is trying to drop off product. actual disaster. this business is forsaken by god
clearly the gods are telling you to relocate may i recommend lovely hillside, coincidentally the next town over from me
they are smart and you are brain dead.

the 90's :sigh:
i see you've basically answered my question already. sorry about that one.
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
trump needs these 3 things to win over black voters:
why even publish this garbage article?
was watching last night. fiancé asked if i wanted to stay up &amp; i said no because ik better and couldn't handle the stress b4 bed...
maybe someday we'll learn better, it might be to ingrained at this point though

update : i fucking hate him now because he's been ignoring me :)
trump believes obama was born in the united states: campaign -
oh wow, big news, nobody cares where trump thinks he was born. why don't you tell us why obama keep sending our tax dollars to iran

does simon own the name 'one direction'? or can the boys come back and still use the name without paying simon?
good question i have wondered about this too
it's okay it's a good question. i actually was called out a few months ago and kindly educated. i left it up as a record.
i struggled with that because i fear the statement is harmful, but ultimately i want to own my harm.
awkwardly tweeted this morning about how i wanted jimmy fallon to run for president before i heard/saw his little bit with trump.
so naturally i immediately deleted the tweet and now i have some feelings and y not get them out, so hi twitter.
i hate it when hotels have body wash instead of bars of soap.
bars of soap are for the olds. and super wasteful since you'd never use a whole one and then they are thrown out.
the tuesday?
yeah. i'm not sure though. how about monday night. they might give us our checks early
what is this!!!! explain right now 😤
you play with him?
we sure can!
i'm serious. i know you're a trip planning goddess.
the presence of love &amp; hard work doesn't prevent total failure as a result. do people delegitimize the term w/overuse? yeah.
one person's opinion of an interpretable piece of expression doesn't define it for everyone.
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
how many times does he have to say they are being audited.

says a lot about how dishonest hrc is that she's losing on honesty ? to someone who lies about things he said on video every single day.
calling out lies is now considered media "bias"
thank you for coming love!
no problem ! good show
that's great to hear. enjoy the rest of your trip! xx
we sure will!!!! thank you!
so naturally i immediately deleted the tweet and now i have some feelings and y not get them out, so hi twitter.
for better or for worse, i really love jimmy fallon. but last night, he was just another straight, white male laughing along with trump.
"we will disrupt their function."
"they shouldn't block the street" riiiiiighttt
so like i said, learn. learn to apologize. own your wrongness in the space. clean your mess and stick around.
and once more this is not about any one person, this is about patterns that play out again and again. &lt;3

wake up america, does this sound like somebody that cares about us...
why are there so many species of bugs, but so few species of human?
because humans destroy each other and can't live in harmony like bugs can. more human species will destroy the planet faster
i thinks he's worse than that. trump makes george w look statesman like in comparison.
i stand corrected. worse than waterboarding. worse than voodoo economics. dismantle the epa! worse than bush.
hope that doesn't sound obnoxious. it wasn't meant to be.

the race card con only works for the uneducated low i q voters ???
president obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. period.
thankk god we are going to get rid of obama and his sick and losing policies
i think there are new gop voters, but they aren't movement conservatives. also, unsure if they outweigh the losses.
my family comes from there too. wash count/sw pa has been moving right for years. not because of trump
for better or for worse, i really love jimmy fallon. but last night, he was just another straight, white male laughing along with trump.
and that really hurts.
trump tells fbn i was "very rude" to ivanka and "really attacked" her "viciously" and calls me "non intelligent"
i wish more journalists would be "very rude" and "viciously" and "really attacked" the trumps with their "non intelligen[ce]"
lol *puts on planning hat* no we def can, let's chat offline about what you're thinking!
ok. we need to chat anyway. monday?
crooked lies about her health because lying is all she knows! americans are way, way smarter than that.
i hope the majority are! because supporters are blind to everything &amp;her many proven lies

if "not warranted" decision keeps stakeholders at the table, includes strong grouse plans &amp; avoids esa backlash, that's a win
some of the "stakeholders" are talking nice to conservationists one minute, and trying to sink sage grouse plans the next.
since the move to 1.0.0, ive needed to add `--repo-update` to `pod install` every time ive run it 😑
depending on what you’re doing then, you may want to use `pod update [pod_name]` instead?
trump has shown again and again that what he aims for is attention--for whatever. almost doesn't matter why. today is a good example.
let him keep on inflating as it will lead to something big ....
so says the man who claimed days ago i knew nothing about russia and putin! you draw conclusions daily on your timeline but 1/

donald trump jr. said the media would be "warming up the gas chamber" if republicans lied the way democrats do
yea, a large part of the population completely agrees with him... the worst dual standard in reporting i've seen in 60 years
for better or for worse, i really love jimmy fallon. but last night, he was just another straight, white male laughing along with trump.
and that really hurt.
says that there is 75% off everything in the store. they aren’t. they are false advertising!

cannot stomach it when i correctly interpret your tweet! you and trump were truly cut from the same cloth, u own his trope 2/
i disagree with him on a lot of things, but really trying to agree with hillary on just one thing, all i see is lies and cover ups
the polls are closer than ever, and the stakes couldn't be higher. chip in today.
you think this is so important because you want to be the first woman president. that is not a good enough reason for me.

ah you libtards can't let go of the fact he's a business man… all campaign merchandise is made in the united states
more voters said trump would bring real change, while clinton was seen as having a better temperament for the job
maybe a better temperament because she would be unconscious most of the time from passing out
happy birthday lovely lady!

lies are deplorable

this statement from the trump campaign on obama's american roots is pathetic, demeaning and shameful. screw them.

the school is lying saying that they left school "on their own accord." they know damn well they sent them back home.

for better or for worse, i really love jimmy fallon. but last night, he was just another straight, white male laughing along with trump.
and you could say this was him doing his job but there's nothing funny about humanizing a monster.
i don't care what trump says today. he lies. the emperor has no facts. heart. empathy. but he has a chance because the media has no shame.

yup. (sorry jeff g. not to stan for you but i feel like i can say "some of my best friends are white guys.")

donald trump still refuses to admit president obama was born in the united states.
there is a reason why. i don't think he was either. i think he was radicalized at an early age.

it took me 5 minutes to find the bathroom but it's fine cause i guarantee my prof is still ranting on hillary
yep.. still on the same slide and talking about hillary
trump tells too much truth? now this will be a problem btwn us, going forward. how can you say this man "tells too much truth"?

besides i know you'll pick iori for the lakers lol

hillary clinton steps into the stephon urkell machine, she comes out as bill's saxophone

my only minor beef with pre-avengers was the final battles we're too short. post i'm spoiled now. how will they top this???
infinity war with 66 heroes on screen, that's how.
which is what has had me fuming since the war began, identifying an entire religion as evil,not fanatics.
i think most true christian/muslims practicing their faith do not believe in the violence espoused by fanatics.
little miss flint met both trump and obama this year.
there are no words to describe how disturbing the picture with trump looks

if you get on i hope it makes the air cuz you know he's gonna hang up on you and call you a fool lmfao
i'm pissed off enough from last night to waste my time and make an ass of myself today. comic relief
there is a racist wanker sitting in front of me on this train. am wondering about confronting him in my poshest haughtiest voice :(

thought about installing natural gas powered whole house generator.then reasoned it may just make house most desirable to mobs
the channel caters to liberal audiences for profit-driven reasons.
dude. i'm liberal. i can barely watch hayes the rest are team dem or corporate sell out. mhp ain't there.
watch this then think about what you would do if you were .
. trump is not special. he can release his but he won't. hrc released years.

figured. thanks. it was certainly the most horrific sports event in my life
report: trump today will ‘likely’ admit — himself — that obama was born in the us | mediaite
and then will say it's sarcasm
you're like a 4 day old bodega roll w/o the bacon egg and cheese and mad hard
love that native new yorker poetic voice
"i was pretty confident about where i was born. i think most people were, as well," obama says
trump-the-schlockteaser. how cocky! as usual,publicity stunt.
"make no mistake - you are the change makers, the path breakers, &amp; the ground shakers." - at the black women's agenda event
wow, that's a really good policy, what does it mean, i'll tell you "i need your vote"

youre right why bother, it's just an accusation.2bad cosby didn't have begala &amp; carville do his dirty work. say hi 2 woody
you're yelling at wind but offering no answers. hard to take u seriously. it's an accusation. when it's a conviction, call me.
isn't it odd the liberals love a man that said 'our laws are below sharia law
george washington never said that!

you're sorry for making him feel wistful? what the fuck, ?
not that every late night show needs to have a liberal bias, but wow, this interview is horrifying
seriously live stream of has been great. even the commercials - dare i say it - seem more enjoyable.
because the commercials are served up with a side of tweets!
was talking about how great his wedding is gonna be with us last night...
bitch all i said is my shit gone be on top of the water, it's not my fault everything i do is million dollar shit
youre right why bother, it's just an accusation.2bad cosby didn't have begala &amp; carville do his dirty work. say hi 2 woody
otherwise, go vote for trump if u like. i don't give a shit. i know what i'm doing.
as does that dumohole but they hide behind being the voice of race awareness &amp; they ain't bout jackbone
. not sure if that is accurate. i do think the issue may be asking to acknowledge one form of terror vs. another

yeah i know, i just meant 2014. i expected a first round exit like clockwork
if this story isn't the problem with dot, trottenberg and nyc's street policies in a nutshell, i don't know what is.
can't we all just relate to it though. [no, bc relying on free car parking in park slope is a fools errand]
bernie sanders on if trump is elected: “try to overcome my depression and figure out where we’ll go from there.”
how can you trust bernie after he slander hrc in the primary's now he worships her bad choice bad govrnment

does hrc listen to herself....

(i mean i am sure she has more important self-care things to do than answering random friend requests but still)
i had fun highlighting some wonderful turns of phrase
thanks man! yeah, i tried to be fair and critique the system on its own terms, rather than just being like "venture capital is dumb."
us customs: "so you're a japan native?" me: "yes...i mean no!" us: "what's your name?" me: "keitar...rich..." us: "step to the side sir..."

i hear the op3 has a bad screen tho
they updated because of some early color reproduction problems but fixed a month or two ago. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yep. further medicaid expansion would shrink the nongroup market in the best possible way.

my second article is up! i analyse the role of a goalkeeper in pep guardiola's tactical system.
keep them coming, this is great education. thank you!
did you not actually read the telegraph article you sent me? says an anonymous "supporter" started it

i meaan not my mans mans, but he cool lol
the fact you are holding a press conference on the "birther" issue just proves you're a racist pos
also, you should all be ashamed of yourself for allowing this racist bullshit to go down.

she started this crap in 08 and it's trumps fault
did you not actually read the telegraph article you sent me? says an anonymous "supporter" started it
i understand you're in denial, but it did in fact start with the hillary camp.
that's probably about right, but from census &amp; cf, it may be as high as 30m. they tried to account
put farrah current enroll and kaiser potential together and already at 75%. but maybe wrong 75%.
shhhhhhhhhhhhh if i read one more iphone 7 tweet from you ....
what? do what you gotta do! i ain't scared
rt if no one asked david tho

thanks to our friends at , here's a new video of us singing "jolene" w/ !
oh my god!!!! my song!! you guys are so perfect 😭😭😭

every person opinions is based on their own personal experience or lack there of .

donald trump calls reporter who grilled ivanka “non-intelligent”
is that a word?
who cares about trump campaign, we want to see him say it . he's a racist lying con man
sadly still more honest than former lady secretary
going out this weekend? we’ve got you covered. here’s a code from bud for a ride home.
no thank you!! don't trust illegal uber or lyft!! only yellow/ green nyc cab !
the gameweek 5 deadline is in three hours don't get caught out...
lad help me. nolito or de bruyne?
here's that prometheus deleted scene . wish they left it in.
i find it weird how far along the cgi is. i mean it's practically done. wonder why they canned it
donald trump was the birther-in-chief. he is still the birther-in-chief.
correction: and are.
but the point that density is achievable without high rises is very important and small devs need to be allowed.
just saying it's not some newfangled thing &amp; 2x is trivial. paris is also 14x as dense as boulder w/o high rises.
truly amazed that w/additional days 2 think &amp; plan, hillary is still one-note johnna. is that all she's got? "go to her website for issues"?
that's all she has
nothing to see here. it's just another paid supporter.
proped up by media
any journalist who covers trump's racist birtherism as he said/she said story should resign immediately. no time for false equivalence
maybe the press should just boycott an announcement from him for a change. just not cover his ass for a chng
we love this slide from showing the aging populations across the globe.
what's with the stereotype icons? all japanese work in rice paddies and all americans are cowboys?
personally i think that's stupid af then!! i love when openers are actually killin it and doin good
an opener will never get a gig again if he tries to go harder than the opener..
trump says he'll make a "major statement" on obama birther issue today:
anything for a photo-op
maybe it has something to do with the color of my skin.
the color of your skin makes up one of millions of characteristics that make humans beings complex.

because it is so visually beautiful. and i loved the history behind it.
yes. absolutely. all who died. all who die in ongoing war of ideals. how about who we might call love?
i see your point and appreciate it but love is a concept and feeling not a god
hahaha do you? what's on it
those listed songs plus "booty me down" "trampoline booty" +others
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
good pointvto bring forward
coincidence? about past the 1 year mark? wife’s watch battery seems to be failing too.
i bought mine on the first day, so maybe. it's at 100% this morning, hopefully that was just a missed charge.
heard the same thing from my friend who works above the apple 5th ave. store.
good to know! i was shocked by this line
my bedroom this morning. castle pass on the pct. a short dirt road off of i-80 meets the trail here.
now back to babylon.
kinda over my liquid foundation... i wanna try something new but i don't want something with spf b/c of flashback &amp; i want a dewy finish 🤔
any recommendations??
again, rumor not proven to come from clinton or her campaign. also see
so if you say, rumor not proven, why bother arguing it? are you privy to some information the rest of america isn't?
i'm not a crazy person so didn't flip out... but what now? they took my name and number and said they'd call me.
troubling. harkening back to the early days of iphone but this is worse because expectations were explicitly set and missed.
this is why fell below msnbc. network of bathhouse club members it is

watch msnbc in 2011: saying hillary clinton started the birther movement.
now they prop her up
anyone in need of some graphic work, or logos...i got time, limited time only 😎
send me your email
so we're no longer jimmy fallon fans cause he interviewed trump?
he can interview whoever, his questions are very soft though. does this to all his guest.
and you as well, weirder. you are a shining beacon of light in a world sometimes full of darkness. a magic missile of hope.
some may think magic missiles of hope cast into the darkness are futile. but once in awhile they hit someone and brighten all.
shoutout to the former boss. yass!!
- watched on he pushed our agenda 2 where it should b-hope he can get his kids 2 get out &amp; vote 4 h
yes, i'm going to check out goblin cock tonight. don't know much about them.
weird name never heard of them 🤔i don't think
in weird way it's beneficial that racist people share on a public platform if the job goes to equally qualified non racist person
ideally they wouldn't be so narrow minded... but at least they are publicly documenting their stupidity for all to see.
when you weren't there.
dude just stop 😂 please show us the link where it states that the owner already approved the move
yeah and stop putting these thots all over your snap, so fucking tired
i like when you talk to me like that baby
honored to speak @ taxpayers against fraud conference last night. here w/whistleblower of year, david kester.
speaking of fraud, when will you indict ?
level of tired: i just put mascara on my eyebrow
part two: i showed up to school at 8am today.....i don't have class on fridays
just love garnet &amp; gold, don't really care for all whites or all garnet either, but at least those aren't cursed by a gypsy
my favorite alternate is white top garnet pants.
i got one the second i got to respectables bc i couldn't wait any longer
i feel you on that
i find it weird how far along the cgi is. i mean it's practically done. wonder why they canned it
damn. it actually makes more sense why he was curled up too--to hide his lengthened limbs
ugh yes!! you can copy my notes &amp; study guide too
sweet. or you can text me pictures of your notes and i'll copy them that way😂
it's a little weird when the phone is completely off as it does nothing. nice unlocking as there's no more "push"
so it’s definitely going to take time to get used to it.
the democratic nominee is sending old folks to ohio to tell scary stories about voting for . politics of fear is all she has.
the old two parties are nothing more than fear this fear that fear him fear her not much about important things

the book w no pictures
on your way home you can stop in st lou and get a mini pig and a delicious sammich.
just don't make my mini pig into a delicious sammich
trump has been in the building for at least 15 mins, but still not at podium. getting a pep talk?
well there's a live feed elsewhere so we don't have to assume.
blocked in the uk ☹️
yeah my bad, i used a song that was copyrighted at the end of the video... sorry dude.
&amp; will out! accidentally lets truth slip about hillary’s ‘supporters’ during broadcast
hes the media village idiot. he&amp;biden must be buddies like dumb&amp;dumber
since ios 10 update, i wake up to negative news about daily. speaking of o.👇🏽
obozo was not born here! the truth will come out soon
you're answer
other la fan who's ass hurt 😭😂
new video: unboxing. you've all seen the black, but what's rose gold like? rt!
waiting vs samsung test .
let's take a look at the live chat while we wait for trump's event to start...
that's a lot of...wow
i had no idea there was a tag this is pretty neat
maybe there wasn't an actual but it was a trending topic and you dominated.
hm, that is really interesting. it very few people who actually hates music itself, so he rarely listen to music?
just disinterested in mainstream music. perhaps he likes classical but nothing under modern label control anyways
when i saw wanted to say: "you are the coolest, i have an overwhelming urge to hug u" played it cool: "ur talk was really good"
that’s usually how i play it too
the game accuses meek mill of being a snitch, threatens to beat him up.
the day of game continues with his meek mill diss song "92 bars"
when are we painting your room 🙄
lmao i hate you. pink is not that. but we should do it... painting &amp; drinks 🤔
trump was 63 minutes late to his own press conference.
but those were good minutes. let me tell you how good they were: you have no idea.
don't ever say "well it can't get any worse"
what about "i got a bad feeling about this"? that's still kosher, right?
appreciation day for this beautiful girl!💗😘
yes the best for last ❤️❤️
this painting is in trump's campaign hq via
. amazing. putin has the same one with small variations hanging in his office. uncanny.
good to know! i was shocked by this line

like tim cook gives a damn?
the brazil and china ones are good
the brazil one is ok. had a lil bit of the greek tzatsiki one (could be better) and haven't had the chinese one. this owns tho
oh look! and some major free press for his new hotel. lol please! 🙅🏾
i must've missed this one but who is opening a new hotel.... you're too funny girl
if trump holds conference abt pbo bc &amp; blames hrc &amp; press stays silent they have abdicated their responsibility as press in a democracy 1/2
and are nothing more than stenographers for propaganda no different than pravda under ussr
maybe trump will actually announce that he is dissolving the massive conflict of interest that is the trump organization
except there isn't one... there's a live feed. blahaha!
there was a antitrust suit in the eyeglass industry in 1940. fdr broke the power of eyeglass companies to gouge.
eye gouging. ow.
any journalist who covers trump's racist birtherism as he said/she said story should resign immediately. no time for false equivalence

. on media narratives-"when the public sees trump as more honest than clinton something has gone wrong."
in your warped word. we, the people, live in reality!
while a tv fool promotes his dc hotel, a real president is at work.
with republicans.
the trump is using this event to promote his new hotel. unbelievable
how much is he paying himself?
hope you don't have anywhere else to be today.
i had mine shipped. out for delivery today. without the painful lines.
another conspiracy theory. as usual you provide no concrete evidence!
. here's proof. trump converted $5k in donations to charity into $5k in free advertising for his business.
. says medal of honor winners 'have a lot more courage than i do."
and of must made them feel so special.

- lets talk about the lies and deception for the past 8 yrs - talk about the $200 million from muslim countries !!
really? we're waiting for a breaking news announcement that trump believes the president of the united states is an american citizen!?
the sad part is that he got 4 or 5 stupid assed black mother f@&amp;$ers to stand by him while he did that crap
these people as president and first lady?😖 repugs are ridiculous!
so tacky and classless.
my boss just randomly started singing niki fm while we were having a meeting this morning so that's where we're at today.

can’t believe his original contract didnt have a non compete in it
can you send me the number that called you as well as the number they told you to call them back at?
i went to the irs web site. the call back numbers the scammers leave all vary
not one of his 13,001 republican opponents called him out for it.
not a single shameless deplorable one
if he really felt different he would have personally apologized 2 bo &amp; then to americans
. trump only looks up to putin.

woot! is that a belly band around the bottom out the real cover?
no way in hell this birtherism charade would be treated with so much nihilistic glee if most newsrooms weren't white as the driven snow
ain't that the truth
1. trump's campaign claims he was convinced obama was a u.s. citizen beginning in april 2011. this is a lie.
i put a bunch of his birther tweets into a moment:
quo in tact. i didn’t even get into the fact that is a large part of the population who would be affected by the racism but
you wouldn’t care. that’s the crux of this.
love how basic commons like this still show the flavor of kaladesh as an anthropocene world

i dig so hard. (not even a minor)
even if this tweet was true about clinton campaign in 2008 – which it is not – this would be bs false equivalency.
exhaustive fact check on it:
so who do u think played the best game??
of the f3 no question its paul.
trump honoring medal of honor recipients, veterans,&amp; a gold star family at dc event.so far no comment birther issue
is that what he's doing? honoring them? or shamelessly hiding behind a "patriotic" wall to promote his hotel? i'm disgusted.
has trump pulled a bait and switch on the cable nets? teased a big birther announcement. then puts up vets who praise him.
and the media fell for it hook line and sinker. they are his biggest source of support by far. it is a disgrace.
i support this decision.
because you are an exceptional human being 🙂
just seem this guy in witch wood!! lol
oh no! i'm happy you escaped! he's a monster of a man ;)
i'm a little concerned for your mental well-being if he wins. no matter who wins, we're all going to wake up nov 9th and go to work
yes, just like when hitler won in germany. nothing really changed.
it's pay day bitches!
can i borrow sum money
now trump getting free airtime for vets ad -- amazing how he games the cable and network people -- by saying he's making 'big announcement'
when will the press get tired of being played??
raputre! columbia is a racist hell hole.
you need the hashtag
donald trump speaking live from his hotel in dc. he is expected to address the birther issue

and that he ushered in regressive policies and almost every point.

then he should have used electric chair or hanging. both more popular forms of execution in the united states
wow, perfect illusion is freefalling everywhere. world is very sad place rn. hope trump can restore it but am afraid it's 2 late for godga

the only reason trump is "overweight" and not "obese" is that he now claims to be 6,3 when before his height was always listed as 6,2
during the gop primaries he was 6' !".
i am so angry at what he is doing right now. parading all these military men who are putting obama down
these men are sexist

it doesn't help that we have glorify a sho where a powerful intelligent black woman is a mistress, to who?
my reference was to scandal.
wine grapes that were harvested yesterday. more harvesting in the morning.
happy harvest!
because you're cold hearted, jk love you 💖
that must be why🤔
but when the media is the only source of a campaigns outreach, it actually matters quite a bit. they bear a responsibility.
they exchange ethics for ratings.
i didn't always have the
legal abilities
is that your best pickup line?
i don't have pickup lines. i just say something stupid and then wave as they leave
bernie would have been so good at this campaign
let that hurt go, big fella
tell you his/her life story? are you two bffs?
i should've told him i'm switching back to if he doesn't get me to bart so i can make it to work on time
ecocor of maine promotes the "no roof overhangs" aesthetic (see image). why? doesn't it rain in maine?

gotcha. thanks for the excellent coverage! i'm following daily.
and we appreciate that, lari, we surely do.--lp
did you know 30 minutes of can improve your &amp; ?
agreed. if i'm unable to go for a run or jog, i'll certainly a good long distance.
and imma just move in with you inside yo purse
no room, my wallet to big
television news producers are killing journalism
it's all about ratings. journalism is dead. just look at the non-coverage of the newsweek article.
called my sprints 10x. no replacements, if i wanted to settle for a s7 or 7edge, i would not have waited for
what are the options for those who need a temp replacement till new safe stock becomes available?
that's gonna be a hard find
walkscore and intersection density numbers suggests there are some hotspots. we're investigating. :) and eating diner food

if you do cop can you grab an extra set of 12s and i'll pay when i get the money no flake
higher ups in the clinton donor/campaign floated pictures and rumors about him being a non citizen muslim

bad behavior leads to major change to kiosks.
maybe they try loading it with useful apps. then can sell the app space to the company for rev and provide relevant service.
using russian straw man to provide cover for democrap election fraud..
that's exactly right. the problem is the "hacker" not the corruption and crime! deflection.
no... but i know you're wishing she did!
the monster vote is coming out for trump 11/9/2016 - she will be shocked that even voter fraud didn't help
as much as stupid dez bryant did but i was counting on gurley the most. 🙄🙄🙄
i have dez too. i'm not worrying tho. he'll be igght
you could try react-router
thanks! my issue there is lack of transitions and native gestures (e.g. swipe from edge on ios). the search continues...
fuck. i need a winter jacket.
thrift stores have the flyest coats

after extensive rift/vive usage, it's very clear that rift is the better product by a long shot. vive'll catch up+head start on hand trcking
the rift is more polished for sure. and the build quality is much better. it's certainly not a better product tho.
who tf going hours?
the hours are ticking
touch id is the best thing.
i agree! but i'm sure he has his reasons so i'm not gonna push for 'em.
push through 👏🏾👏🏾you got it
it's so hard yo. i'm so tired of everybody expecting me to have my life planned
even nissa loves this place.
all that said, kaladesh is a wonderful foil to the upcoming conflict between the gatewatch and phyrexians :,)
depressing overcast weather greeting me
give it like 3 hours and it won’t be overcast anymore! lol

your welcome and thank you, too! have a wonderful weekend! xoxo
yeah this reads to me as "be aware this game is different" than anything really negative.
yeah, i do think it's going to be a rude awakening for anyone used to modern games
i can't believe i missed this tweet. it is the best thing.
this will be happening my entire life and there's nothing i can do about it.

rick just stop ✋ you're already a tool on twitter and a low life.
like a month before this launch i got a xb one that came w 16. so i jussst started trying to get back to it.
what's your gt?
groove was never there
haha. i've prob never had the real groovy kind. i think the whole movement of elevating old ashkenazi fare is kinda cool tho
as a reporter covering trump for news, right now, i feel like i’m being swindled. an hour and a half late, and so far its a campaign ad.
then walk out.
sorry to disappoint you.
that wasn't a shot at you. it was sarcasm aimed at him.
pierce the veil, against the current, too close touch, more talk about their first concerts

i know i had to hit you with the change up 😘
but pls do explain how silently &amp; peacefully making a statement is ignorant compared to white kids saying they should be shot
these two facts should not be airbrushed out of the story of trump's birther back-down:
birtherism is the foundation upon which trump gleefully built his political fortune. he knew what he was doing.
not my justice im just a
faithful steward of it 😎
i swear that's the first thing i asked

of course, dealing seriously with ubi means getting basic questions answered. what a cop out.
basic questions 1: can we cut defense globally in half? 2. is there the will to do ubi? we are starting a discussion.
with talk of bloody insurrection, kentucky’s governor invoked a violent, racist history:
. repubs need to get their heads out of their ass. white supremacists, racists, kkk supporters of trump are worried about violence?
we dont tell our fathers we love them enough. tell ur dad u love him. whatever dad means to u. dad's up above and here with us, we love u.

flynn asks for moment of silence for u.s. pow/mia recognition day day. trump once said mccain wasn't a war hero because he got captured.
this is a prime example of ! this is why the am people have such a poor judgement of the press. stop !
hey developer friends - anyone with magento expertise? may have a project to refer you to - agency/contractor role. dm me if that's you!

trump begins his big speech: 'when the hotel opens it will be one of the great hotels in the world... ' yet again, you couldn't make it up.
no doubt he will receive a big fat fee for the honor of using the hotel that bears his name.

it's like a rollerbrush on the app artrage.

but i don’t like how it seems we are getting further from goood sound quality with every new product coming out
oh my god. how is everyone so mad at jimmy fallon for being "playful" with donald trump. he's a comedian. the show is a comedy show.
if you're making major political decisions/voting on the basis of what u saw on "late night with jimmy fallon" then you have bigger problems
it's for the greater good.
my thought precisely
that ain't no sexy walk she hit the ugly walk..... we finna blame it on the boot tho
imma need you to quick suckin me boo
that's happening in products like tetration &amp; arcsight
thanks for adding more to my frame of reference, and that too, early in the morning.

there was a moment when could have said we will get back to this if the candidate speaks. guess they missed that moment.
that moment was "deplorables are deployables", and long past.

still staying away from cruz in all formats. upside just isn't there. he might be in his miles austin phase.

remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
news media should stop given trump free tv .

christina really nifty poll. can i ask which widget did you use to create it?
twitter polls
the (correct) reasoning is that he is legitimizing racism misogyny homophobia, etc by even inviting this guy onto his show
trumps done rounds of all major comedy shows(incl. snl)in past decade.what fallon did is no diff frm what's already been happ
tt the whole season, no matter what happens
fair enough. the guy has to improve quickly though, still doesn't see the middle of the field. his ol gave him all day

pres. obama 'shocked' at birther issue: "i was pretty confident about where i was born."
guess he never spoke to his grandmother who said he was born in kenya. democrats are good at creating false documents.
i won't deny, it is a funny front page.
how can they get away with putting that picture of her though? lmao they aged her by 2 decades
the understanding was that trump's event would be a presser. but media sitting six rows back, in roped off area. very hard to ask questions.
then idk, leave? should we feel bad for you? you all know the definition of insanity, yeah?

i mean, just wait and if trump pauses for breath, say loudly, politely, and exhaustedly "you're lying"
hrc has been consistently dishonest since being kicked of watergate team,it's fun watching left panic now that polls shifted

trump would stay longer, but he's got hotels to open in brockway, ogdenville and north haverbrook.
in any case, i'm looking forward to jimmy fallon's "lip-synch battles" with putin and kim jong-un during november sweeps.
barack obama was born in america, plain and simple. donald trump owes him and the american people an apology.

his passion and enthusiastic support of hrc is inspiring. said no one.

none. they are all listening. and they seem, for the most part, to be paying attention. it got boring a couple days ago

how many times does trump have to scream at his rallies about how much he hates the press before the press believes him?
i think the press thinks that as long as he talks about them it's good for them. they're just like him.

welcome to the winning team

this was me during season 1 and 2 ok

where are the men who put their children first, that is willing to go above and beyond to make you feel special, and hold you at night?
right here love :0
it is indeed! especially if what you're doing are voxel-esque models :p
i got a lot of critique on my ks and most of it was "ditch the voxels". mine aren't as elegant as yours. heh. we'll see. :)
'barack obama was born in the united states. look at the gold toilets in my hotel. these are fantastic gold toilets.'
trump should be fined $6 million for hate speech.
bernie votes are on a scatterplot. theyre not flocking 2 any one direction. those are the people who just dont want the same thing
we had a clinton and a bush in this election...we let them choose dynasties for us like this is a parliament.
these tweets about this trump event are hilarious. the media let itself get played over and over and this is like a capper.
that these reporters were up for treating trump supposedly repudiating birtherism like meaningful news should embarrass them all
i would love to do all of the gem social media when this reunion happens! xx 🙏🏼❤️
please do! i'm a big supporter of whatever project the girls get involved in.
exclusive: brian france says nascar would like to add another manufacturer(speedonfox)
i always respected you and loved your outlook, and your workout regimen. wow. you are a great patriot and enjoy seeing you .
it's hers lmao it's so cute
loooool it is so cute you would roast me if that was me on snap
president obama’s successor cannot and will not be the man who led the racist birther movement. period.
this is about the fifth time you have mentioned this. i don't even think was born here
i think it's closer to 12 blocks but point taken
you be my eye in the sky; i'll be at ground zero!
yes, i would like an answer to this myself!
does any1 care about this? maybe u all need 2 go this way!
only civilized america vomited, trump supporters are cheering
so now they'll change their beliefs because the grand poo bah *lies* and says it's so? deplorable.
discovering it's absolutely impossible to write about pine barrens without subconsciously (and hopelessly) trying sound like john mcphee.
it is like you left nj when you enter pine barrens
more: trump says "president obama was born in the united states. period."
ffs, that's your headline??? 😡😡😡
i think you played a small part too! congrats!!
a huge part! that's why she got to saber champagne 🍾
every time iphone comes out, everyone is disappointed and then they buy it anyway.
sure , this will continue. i'm seeing that what was a black/white msft/appl decision now has become more grey for many.
birther: trump event goes on live cable tv for over 20 minutes and then says, very briefly, that obama was born in the usa
i want obama to call bruce and approve the use of "born in the usa" at every appearance he does for hillary.
what did i miss
they just showed 20 mins of trump being praised because he said he'd address the birther issue.
accidentally got into a welfare debate with my friend and he stopped responding so i think i pissed him off
it's much easier dealing with friends who yell instead of giving the silent treatment.
the human toll of the philippines’ war on drugs
killing all drug dealers will save millions of lives and families. bravo for taking a stand!
trump just aired free 30 min endorsement from veterans at his new hotel to falsely say clinton started his conspiracy theory about president
no. the press did. you all allowed him to do exactly what you knew he would do.
looking forward to your challenge
right? this feels very up our alley re and precision public health
is that even possible?? 😂
😂😂 i don't plan on trying to find out!
he was talking about jhene aiko, now that's everyone's girl 😂
bino hit it first 😂
coming from the woman who used laugh while brutally humiliating women with "curves" (biggest loser), this is rich
is there truth to this?
immigrants aren’t somehow changing the american character; immigrants are the american character.
muslim immigrants are your fantasy world
that i find a little disrespectful, having family and friends fighting and dying for america. but that's just my opinion
black lives matter doesn't mean police, military, white, asian, brown, etc. lives don't matter
friend our fb acct and we let you in, it's that easy! 🙂
i'm in now!
trump doubled down on lie-filled statement from his campaign last night &amp; took no responsibility for his bigoted attacks on our president
i am so angry that he came out right now for 10 words and blamed it on hrc
i actually think this might have been the final straw for many in the media - they're tired of being played for fools by trump.
one can wish.
" i fuckin love you, girl " kiss kiss hug hug ...welcome
that's mousetastic

are u too young to be a dad at 26 tell me wikihow
don't think so, i have a cousin who was a dad at like 25 i think
wtf is going on? i'm just getting online for the first time today
trump billed a press conference to talk about birther issues. conference doesn’t start till an hour later. 30 mins of ppl
discussing this today.
any live viewing feed?
sure , this will continue. i'm seeing that what was a black/white msft/appl decision now has become more grey for many.
outlook, surface are good mobile products by now imo
found the school that zakiyah works at &amp; i'm getting her fired. im sending videos of her actions on tv via email &amp; in person
what did she do that was so bad to warrant this? ive only seen her thirst after some d &amp; throw away some cookies...wth!
john king: “we just got played. we just got played. and voters can decide what to make of that."
it's the truth — news organizations have a responsibility to work smarter. trump is wily but a known entity
why is this rambling trump event being cover in total? this is what ppl are talking abt. this is not "earned" media bc it's not newsworthy…
i am so angry at him right now.
trump: hillary clinton campaign started "birther issue... and i finished it."
please don't give trump air time. he made a fool of the media
hillary started the birther issue but trump finished it: obama you are officially born in america, congratulations.
fuck trump and his bs,,,you are all scumbags
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
just do what you
damn, that's the realest thing i've ever heard.
that is an awesome way to look at it o_o
would be much better if they focused on those in 200%-400% who get small subsidies - not those who get none.
well, they're rolled together in that se. &amp; do we know takeup among &gt;400% fpl?
immigrants aren’t somehow changing the american character; immigrants are the american character.
you are the very worst president america has eveer had
wtf is going on? i'm just getting online for the first time today
endorsing trump as the introduction and then 45 seconds of trump saying that obama was born in the us…after he lied and said
the campaign is not letting a reporter come along for the hotel tour. just cameras. i wonder why!
photog for 38 years... we are reporters.
today is my driving test! and im gonna do great but im a but nervous! i got this!!!
good luck! kick that road's ass :v
since the dawn of time, humans have been hacking life
time: the original life hack
wtf is going on? i'm just getting online for the first time today
that hillary started the rumors. the journalists are all pissed off, i’m pissed off…i hate trump so much.
donald trump: "president barack obama was born in the united states. period."
this is just a circus. so trump is announcing what everyone has known forever? this is what the media calls news?
i'm just suggesting there are other ways or days they could have done it. maybe a week of all black or something?
i can see that as well, because it can be easily misinterpreted on america day.
any reading you could recommend me about game design? :)
a book of lenses is pretty great reading for designers looking to improve their game.
thank you guys for your time and enthusiasm! it was way relaxed and fun! x
happy to tell you that i'm voting for in the elections
is this sorority rush? like, what??
i prefer to think of it as a slutty co-ed fraternity
remember: trump, the birther-in-chief, still refuses to even release his own tax returns and real medical records.
you started the birthed movement in 2008 lest you forget.
new clinton campaign video: "birther"
she is only trying to win back her base. we need to start spelling desperate with an -hrc
to the average voter, this will make media questions about trump's "past birtherism" look hysterical and pointless.
trump is a hate monger who belongs in prison for his hate speech.
as of now we are closed due to the weather. will update if we decide to open!
will you be open today (friday)
...but then, imagine how richard dawkins feels about "meme."
i find one of the worst bits of culture to be the misuse of "meme". it is such a helpful concept!!!
everybody thinks they're the good guy. very few people wake up in the morning and say "i'm really excited to be evil today"
i do , not gonna lie. but you knew that.
why should taxpayer fund this anymore? join the unmissable tonight with arnab goswami
is it true this bad sounding hash tag but reflect reality - is trending?
yep our media is totally hoodwinked when it come to trump.. 36 hours of media anticipation for dr oz wtf -over
it's a show -- it's the kardashians on the national - global stage. news organizations must be smarter!
ok i have literally been through every person on tinder.
same. it sucks.
are all the nets still live on this? curious.
no! the clintonnewsnetwork just insulted pow/mia recognition day! was a huge snark when vets are the message! sad!
i don't need a gun to feel safe. i have a brain, common sense, &amp; live in a peaceful civil society w/ rule of law.
thank you! thank you! where do these people go or not go. i've been in dicey situations and still got out alive sans gun.
hell yeah when can you?
we were like two ships passing in there night :/

uh, because she cannot win and at best she can get enough votes to elect trump...
so just found out my journal was thrown away in nevada..there's no feeling in the world to describe the desolation i feel inside my soul
who threw it away? why would someone do that? that's so horrible 😞
i literally skipped class bc i found out my school had a pho building station and had to go try it....
update: no ragrets bc it was 100% worth it
discussing this today.
in mountain view? or one of the other campuses?
trump in dc: "hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. i finished it. i finished it. you know what i mean."

pablo had me dying 😂😂
pablo ain't shit he knew it was over 😭
today, the breaking news is that gop presidential nominee has decided that our first african american president is a legitimate president.
how does his base take this? because they do not agree.
this is where we're at as a country: it's news when a presidential candidate admits the president of the us is american.
donald trump is a national disgrace. this election is beyond embarrassing.

i actually think this might have been the final straw for many in the media - they're tired of being played for fools by trump.
i hope you're right about that. that was my first instinct too. but then i came back to... nah, it will keep happening.
donald trump still refuses to say was born in america. and this man wants to be our president? when will he stop this ugliness?
how many times are you going to run with this. it is stupid o your part. obama is a jerk and stupid
that's nuts! can you get librarian's contact info? i'll send them a thank you card!

best of luck to you man.
...thank you my good brother !
oh what the fuck. appalling.
he got half an hour of free tv time. what the actual hell. media are pissed off that he rickrolled them.
i have notifications enabled for actual breaking news, aka "hey the entire world is on fire", not this crap.
if journalists actually acted like journalists, trump wouldn't even be in this position. this election is a macabre circus
despite what donald trump may say, immigrants are not rapists and criminals.
but lots of them are

nasty!! these hotels were caught for not changing their sheets

i've always wanted to get magnets printed that say 'i drove in the bike lane' or 'i parked in a bike lane' 'i almost hit a cyclist
stickers though - the cheap kind that tear and leave adhesive when you try to remove them.
trump finally dropped his unfounded doubts about obama's qualifications: "president barack obama was born in the united states. period."
um, but he lied in the process if doing so
totally on our (somewhat lengthy) tbr list!
i'll have to send pixies over to move it to top of your tbr list. ☺️ happy reading!

yes, i think she has just tried to clarify, not retract. we know who she meant.
no! it isn't breaking news when donald trump finally acknowledges a fact.
it is when refuses to get questioned over his statement

now trump appears to be refusing to acknowledge reporters’ questions at what he billed as a _news_ conference.
it's not a "news conference," it's the aristocrats!
second update: that did not work. skedaddled without taking questions.
the dear leader doesn't take being challenged well
then she needs to stop claiming she's trying to redeem herself or being fucked over by editing &amp; just lean into being a villain
it's not villainous to treat your fellow queens as competitors

shout out to the team for such a thoughtful and on-point gift!
trump said he believes obama was born in us but didn't explain why he changed his mind. has been no new evidence since '11 birth certificate
his campaign made him say it.
he also sprinkled it with puritan history.. really!!! sociopaths
these guys don't matter

there is no violence at hillary's rallies. all the violence is at trump's rallies and trump is a violent sick man that needs help

in '08 whan hillary supporters claimed that obama wasn't born in america, why didn't she call her supporters a basket of deplorables???
maybe it was because the only ones who did so were fringe supporters who did so after she endorsed obama.
i'll introduce you to the king of dreams via :

i'm glad that 's little game backfired. i'm finally enjoying to hear some discussion on . using the military too is just sick!

honestly my favorite picture on the internet atm
i think grubman is coming to tell oakland it's now or never. city has had years and years to assemble a plan. nada.
😂😂😂😂 you're a fool if you believe that
hillary clinton did not start birtherism. that's an outright falsehood. this was an unfounded right wing conspiracy theory.
but what happened to the bs 'investigators' who found things "we would not believe"?
✈️vegas bound to 🍾celebrate my sweet friend's last girls trip before getting 👰! has you covered on qp.
yoga pants and a tito's and oj?
if trump loses it's his fault.if clinton loses it's her fault. partisans quit whining about the media, &amp; hold your own candidate accountable
how to be polite when someone is talking like an idiot- media gave trump a billion in free air time this yr- you are to blame

non fairfax employed, but am holier than thou (so i suppose "fairfax type"), and tbh that list sounds pretty good.
you do resemble that remark
1. someone sent a book to my nyc address without contacting me/my editor/my agent first so i have no idea to keep an eye out for it
2. i just picked up mail after 3 months so it's been sitting there this whole time gathering dust and now it is impossibly short deadline
it's a graveyard in here, folks. won't anyone make a stapler that can survive a college…
can you help us? make a stapler that will hold up to college students!
well that was a clusterfuck for the trump campaign
sure, but he'll probably gain a point in florida because hillary coughed.
how will they come back as a luxury?
people still love and will love human touch, originality; these products will be a luxury as digital economy is destroying em
the birther movement started by a anonymous email from a clinton supporter. (oops i think i know a anonymous person who is good with emails)
that did not start a movement. don't you know what a movement is?
years and years? well kind of, but 38 is more then years and years. i call it decades mark. 🙄

i'm so over it omg, like this is all getting ridiculous and taking the fun out of the game

trust me bzgrill, will not make you press any of those, just purely enjoy it! haha
trump's claim that clinton started the controversy is false. you can read more here &amp; here
incorrect. research mark penn, 2007 chief clinton strategist.
there is no memory hole, folks.
but there sure is a big ass hole....
im so excited
im counting down the damn seconds
this is a perfectly normal media event perfectly. normal.
have close exprnc w/this type. gov bebe had2 help &amp; it reached state supreme court
one thing you can't convincingly be right now is shocked. i vote for everyone calmly reporting that trump lied, then moving on.
i'm shocked that he managed to walk off the stage rather than droning on for an hour.
all good tho
it was fun tho
donald trump: “president barack obama was born in the united states. period."
you guys got played like children. who ever made that decision to let that go on for a half hour should be re assigned

gotta get off this endless cycle of streaming too much and not waking up in time to stream.
at least you can say you have developed a committed routine. that's difficult in itself.
beautiful friday!!!! salute
thank the lor, for a good friday, thank you jesus!
we've got a feeling you won't leave disappointed! keep us in mind, okay?!
i most definitely will :)
what? i cannot. he's the one who started it. wow.
he didn't just start it, he's kept the questions going for five years since obama produced the birth certificate
how about giving unselled items to homeless people at instead of throwing them in the rubbish?

how's your morning going!
ok now i'm confused lol
let's start over. hi chloe !!! how's your day going ?
by "network news" you refer to media neutrality. by the way, washington post confirmed hillary started obama birtherism.
no, they didn't.
ok guys, and i challenge you for the best photo caption on here! be creative 😉
for sure that is photo shopped. it can't possibly look that good!
just listened to a woman break up with her boyfriend over the phone while on the toilet ama
who's fault did she say it was?
5 minutes of xbox, 5 minutes of sony, 5 minutes of nintendo, 5 minutes of computer games. is that how producing a show works?
unfortunately, like broadcasters, we podcasters are bound to the equal-time rule
i love college football too, but how can penn state honor a coach who covered up child abuse for 30+ years? come on.
so torn on this issue. my mother was born 20 years and a month before joe pa started coaching nearly down the street from stad

goodmorning :-)
i will never understand this, it's not like it's some limited release
agreed. i have an appointment, but there is a hugeeeee line of people without one who have been camping out for hours here
there's a card game about getting into berghain and it's following me on instagram.
does every card just say "sorry, not tonight"?
got a black 128gb one reserved for 8am but stay tuned ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
good luck. getting black 7+ 32gb (probably should gone for 128) in sf this afternoon.
i already have infrastructure to do that for other cases, it's just annoying. twitter should really hire me to beef up their search api.
twitter really should hire you to beef up its nazi filters.
"uh folks, this is ahh, your captain speaking. looks like the gentleman in 37d is in the toilet so, uh, feel free to go through his stuff."
i'm confident this is the scenario described in "aisle seat 37d"

i would prefer columbia if i wasn't scared of heights, so rapture for me please

i sincerely apologize for an abrupt phrase. i spoke out loud without elaborating. my apologies.
yes! rhp and skm are perfect for this time of year. skm's 'april' is my go-to autumn-to-winter album.
y'all its still summer for a few days come on now :(
you can book uber rides in advance in 8 more uk cities starting exactly now.
you don't have there?
so torn on this issue. my mother was born 20 years and a month before joe pa started coaching nearly down the street from stad
it's so ugly that he (probably) was involved in this ugly cover up and is definitely at fault in its continuance.
deep stress underlies all problems. what if we had a technology to heal it? a new paradigm for world
you say the problem is stress, yogis say it is wrong understanding about ones's own divine true nature
i hope nobody is going to be rude on twitter today.
it only took me 5 minutes upon waking to get my first death threat!
breaking: donald trump reverses himself and acknowledges fact that president barack obama was born in the united states.
"this is fine"
experts from a variety of fields:diplomatic,military,museum, legal,antiquities experts unite on
happy to participate in this important dialogue about stemming market demand for conflict antiquities w/
sometimes i am old-school like that
if there were more like you, i bet that brick and mortar store wouldn't be closing.
on the upside...i helped some kids learn a thing today.
except i fucked up while i was helping them with their second problem and well...yeah but that's when the teacher called the activity over
hillary aide mark penn's '07 racist "birther" strategy memo, to use against obama cc:
where's the part that says hillary didn't believe obama was born in the usa?
to recap: even as trump reversed his birtherism he still perpetuated another lie - that birtherism started with clinton's camp in '08
now people start looking at what hrc actually did during the '08 campaign. it's still doesn't look good for her........
so first debate for trump: if obama was born in the us why did you keep questioning it?
because there was such a shroud of mystery bo should have just put the bc out
how is bojangles not commanding a serious lead
agreed. can't believe there is even a poll for this.
understanding the constitution isn’t merely an academic exercise. it’s essential for democratic participation.
shocking is a gross understatement
they have not received my phone at the palo alto store!!
they don't have my reserved iphone in the palo alto store yet even with a reservation!

it's so ugly that he (probably) was involved in this ugly cover up and is definitely at fault in its continuance.
the devastation inflicted on that campus by those actions is unprecedented.
the birther issue is not important to americans, its only important to the left wing media because they're the ones that keep pushing it!
shut the fuck up

another thiing-clinton coverage been overwhelmingly neg. trump has gotten free pass on trump u, trump foundation hiding taxes
we cannot allow ourselves to be divided by the bigoted, xenophobic hysteria the republican party has concocted.
border security and not wanting to pay taxes for illegals is neither bigoted nor racist !!

that's interesting.
here is the top of trump's speech - the gop nominee promoting his new hotel at campaign event:
"medal of honor winners" sir, one does not "win" the medal of honor. using these gr8 people to promo your hotel isn't honorable.
sometimes the only person who understands you is yourself.

hidden in the horrific loss is how bad boston's bullpen and starting pitching is. after price is what? porcello?😂😂😂😂😂
you need to look at two things right now: the standings and a calendar.
kudos to msnbc. check out the middle chyron below. they inserted "falsely."
except that face of is still there!
while we're on the topic, he also implied the white house murdered someone to keep obama's birthplace secret.
i don't even have words man. dude is on some other shit.

luckily towns, cities and all things related to it is my actual background ;) second nature to design them :p
sure but will your town be floating in black void like that in the game? how will you handle the border of the terrain?
i would not hype it unless i was actually impressed. and i was so much more impressed than i thought i would be.
i believe it. all the previews look wonderful
if you had to design 30 minutes of politics to break mainstream journalists out of their false balance problem, that was it.
impossible. economics are stronger than ethics.

lobbying, petitioning the gov't. gov't action will impact many people, some very significantly. right to
i agree completely. i am not against lobbying.
why? trump's an entertainer, he got media to watch him entertain--plus he admitted sun rises in east, gets "credit".
i think mckay's onto something. his moments of greatest hubris hurt him every time. and debate frame now set.
lol why not give them a proper employment contracts then

he was adamant abt this all to delegitimize pres.

not just sad. pres. nominee just lied in front of america denying role in founding the birther movement.that's news
hope this dominates the news today, but just wanted to say great speech by last night, really effective.
let's be clear , trump is not doing this cuz he suddenly thinks pbo was born here, his camp is making him
whether truly believed it or did it for media attention's immaterial
the nra is poised to pour more than $15 million into ads in several battleground states to defeat hillary clinton.
dt 4 prez! so you can buy more, shoot more, be more. the alternative is dire: no guns, no shooting, no more. all less. dt/nra/lol
started reading black company last night. seems awesomely dark so far. i've clearly been missing out.
is it anything like hammer's slammers?
trump just aired free 30 min endorsement from veterans at his new hotel to falsely say clinton started his conspiracy theory about president
but she did, there is too much evidence proving it, you libs are all alike, just like lying hillary
join for a run on 9/19:
best of luck on the 19th!
like trump's racism and sexist remarks, can you imagine how screwed up his kids are?
also his grandchildren.
. "actually" and "technically" guys are the eyeroll inducers of the world.
yeah, it is inconvenient to be corrected, and lucky for me, i didn't use either word
ugh.. so much for building trust around end of life care.
this piece conflates hospice with palliative care, talks about discharge from "a hospice".

do they run true to size? or do they run big?
the women's shirts are junior fitted tee's if that helps
i’d laugh if trump doesn’t mention birther issue at all at this press conference in dc. use hype to get ppl to watch veterans praise trump!
come on guys, how brilliant was that executed! news media gets totally played by trump. wall-to-wall coverage.
just in: donald trump reverses himself and acknowledges pres. obama was born in the united states
you need to report this accurately - it is surrounded by lies - this is a partial telling of trump's pr spin

trump, clinton are nearly tied in new michigan poll | the daily caller
i cant believe they r tied, seriously?? what crazy morons are voting for hillary???
does anyone have any doubt that trump would view the presidency primarily as a way to enrich himself?
his campaign headquarter rental bill agrees with you.
guys remember when obama took down trump within hours of authorizing the bin laden raid
yeah, thank god that was the key moment in trump not winning the nomination
let's be clear , trump is not doing this cuz he suddenly thinks pbo was born here, his camp is making him
pushed a racist conspiracy theory.
why isn't president obama working instead of campaigning for hillary clinton?
have someone read the constitution to you: 'cause you r a "domestic security threat" which he is sworn to protect us from
you might as well smile
you just made me smile! thanks! love you glen! thanks 4 all the years of making us smile laugh &amp; cry, god bless
actually you are wrong. it's okay tho, most real americans don't believe the medias lies.
you're either an idiot or a con-artist if you think hillary is responsible for birtherism.
people will never be able to recall 95% of the good things you do, but they'll remember 99% of the shady stuff you've done.

djat is first a businessman it's money and more money

what's wrong with this??
wouldn't be a problem if ya wasn't so damn obvious
let’s hope. remember how the media stopped asking about clinton’s emails (maybe)? maybe this is the turning point.
i said it this morning:media would fall for latest scam &amp; give more free time to lie - they love the shiny object
surly they knew that already?? idk, some ppl do have their head in the sand

we're not safe now with obama, would be worse with hrc
you are unfortunately correct. and what's worse - we're all part of the problem when we tune in. what's the solution?

break - trump tv pool voted to pull the camera from trump hotel tour and not air footage
but there's civil journalists to step in. blahahahah. i can't get enough of his brilliance. ty
same here! i use for some things, but not sure i'd want to lean on it yet for customers/users.
.. here's your answer to whether you should go all in matt ;)
that stunt was the most vile, insulting thing i’ve seen this campaign season.
i am sickened. anyone voting for trump is an idiot.
trump didn't start , it was michelle. trump just took her word. she can't be wrong...or is she racist?
she is definitely a racist, she hates caucasians
section 8 where they can move in a nice neighborhood. stay in your lane. if they want better housing they can move
you are the cookie cutter politician who has been keeping blacks thinking they're too stupid and can't complete with the rest
(i'm not entirely convinced.)
i know exactly what show he's talking about. it's actually not. think of three judge judys presiding over a case. that's it
you doing it from a laptop or from icloud? i always just post up with my laptop before wiping the device and leaving store.
icloud — should have done laptop
of course lol
mark don't u have something to do?
trump is not fascist the 3 defining features of fascism are fear, entitlements and state appropriation of the private sector
aww. and i thought you had learned enough to stop throwing big words around that you don't understand.
you, too. see you on monday (or in passing on sunday) 👋😁 *hugs*
👏👏😎 might check in early for
“hillary clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy,” mr. trump said. “i finished it.”

harry reid goes off on donald trump: "what a liar!"
reid is the liar
but it was trump who has consistently advanced a dishonest narrative about the president's birthplace.
those not willing to vote hrc (understandable) keep scotus in mind. push for a progressive nominee
i've been in class all morning with last night's yankee/red sox game on my mind....... i'm still bothered by it smh
like i feel we won't beat them again for the rest of the season.
the are losing big time!! makes desperate gamble with her birther movement and loses big time!!
that she did! disgraceful woman
most embarrassing update ever made by press home to unlock; we want slide to unlock in

i am so excited for this vlog. 🙈💁🏻🙅🏻💀
the tea will be served
she was sooo dead ass serious too 😭
what's a asian type ? like korean chinese japanese ?
donald trump backed off birther claims: "president barack obama was born in the united states, period.”
the idea that he makes this statement without noting that it was knowingly divisive and intentionally so is simply unacceptable
deff gotta put dave east in there
yeah he up there for sure but q and nino are dead nice af

happy birthday brotha we haven't talked in forever forever forever but i hope that your day is fantastic because you rock
thanks kencell, be sure to hit my line
i'm thinking this whole donald charade is about making $, like a businessman would do. today's "announcement" at his new hotel is an example
so, as a businessman donald will appeal to a certain customer type, and then expand the base by vilifying the competition.
you mean...it stars the two men i'd actually consider marrying?
but only one who has voiced a cat.
happy birthday !! hope college is going good have a good one🎉🎉

hillary campaign plays ""i feel good" by james brown as she walks on stage. (james brown died of pneumonia).
thats so ironic! james brown was a wife beater, he deserved to die
this is the tweet that caused me to create ddm. i thank the dumbass nigga who made this shit.
shut the fuck up.
trump campaign manager joins us sunday to discuss the race, so tune in!
i have to ask, why do you interview people who do not answer your questions? as a viewer its infuriating.
q is there a challenge in terms of public perception if % of investment in development is earmarked for m&amp;e and now open data?
and a further % on research communication / uptake?
so honored: jim brown statue to be unveiled sunday; watch for exclusive photos, video

cool how some customers take you not having a sandwich in stock as a deeply personal insult from you to them
that sandwich was their only joy in life
true. so do you think it's because the economy is bad or simply because we (gays) are looked down upon for being different?
actually being from dallas, moving to kansas now living in san francisco working with hiv &amp; aids group. its all about testing.

raw materials. naval bases. trade markets.
as commander-in-chief, he is sworn to protect us from threats both foreign and domestic. you, sir, are the latter.
george you're are absolutely right our is working tirelessly to protect us from trump!
"hillary clinton's support of palestinian terrorism"
media's support of hillary
so, as a businessman donald will appeal to a certain customer type, and then expand the base by vilifying the competition.
if you look what he's done, is simply sales 101!
honestly i'm just done letting my people be disrespected and walked all over. we're not here for your damn entertainment and exploitation.
this whole world got me fucked up and i'm not with it.
why are people still poking me on facebook
because your white 😂😂😂😂
, you know there's race as white, it's an invented term meant to cause classism. they are americans from european descent.
stop, no one needs an obama lecture, we need trump action for jobs and sensible healthcare
even fox news says hillary clinton didn't start the birther movement.
. rut roh! trouble in trumpistan?
what ails general hospital?
good read . but your take on the vante/lante s/l .. not sure i agree

lol i tagged rob. he's the guy you gotta talk to
finished, donald trump addressed the "birther issue " quickly &amp; firmly..done , watch hillary,she just she has nothing
she is nothing

waking up at 8:30 with an email from your professor that your 8:30 has been cancelled is probably my best college experience yet

because u &amp; your sidekick stay lying about your height so i believe you're average height.
the blue curtain at the back of the ballroom in the trump hotel just collapsed, taking down some american flags with it.
that was me and
why do people keep asking trump re obama's birthplace? guy's been telling us for 7 years what he damn well thinks!
trump either is a stupid man or doesn't believe in us law &amp;order.it is like saying trump is a woman.

hate you both
one minute she hates my guts, next minute i'm in hers
here's the other:
:o. so majestic, so perfect. thank you!
anyway, enough of that. you seem like a good guy (tl browse) and arguing over silly stuff is... well... silly.
all good, cap!
yes! i read when it first came out. crimes were unheard of! well written. couldn't put down.
i read it at 19 &amp; would not bring into my apt at night. it scared me and i lived alone. i'm a whack
dude has a basket full of deplorable tendencies and america needs to excise this ugly and virulent strain from our politics 2/
lets talk about that on nov 8 midnight
well said. the money is inconsequential! and i'll see you out there on sunday, but running a 9:50 pace
see you there man (and thanks).
you follow another one of those hit team media groups....believe it from clintons campaign..

i'm so tired of having to walk thru disgusting ass toxic tobacco smoke clouds to exit marillac.

rewatching the opening drive right now, absolutely amazing fitz had the game he had after this drive. this drive was a mess
cannot agree more. thought fitz was lost forever at that point in the game
he plays the media like a stradivarius. and they love it, as it generates ratings &amp; revenue. we're in big trouble.
as a voter, i don't allow the media to sway my opinion of dump. unfortunately, most of the public are intolerable and racist.
hey sam whats this?
and told me all the cool kids did it.
lol.. both are making $$$ -- while you shoring up hillary &amp; the others shoring up da donald. how about getting them to make u$
a company/service provider has no duty to make their customers money. corporations, like donald's, are in for themselves.
cuz no one wants ur bf
ok son. i'm glad to hear that. thank you for lifting me up on this fine ass friday afternoon.

i understand their role in black culture but i'm 99% sure it's not something that was exclusively to it
first of all, rastafarian and black culture are two different things and two, why is hair becoming a race thing?
cnn tone towards trump takes a definite turn, after birther announcement. john king "he played us."
i think it was monty python who had a segment on "getting hit on the head lessons." who knew it was dt's press pool?

i actually thought she killed it on her lip sync. it's so unfair how much shit she's getting when alaska.....
alaska admitted phi phi was asked questions!
received this email on 9/7 warning me something was happening. this means people knew weeks ago!
i wish i received it as well. my last submission was three days ago.
the next several days of birther coverage is really gonna get those white women in philly suburbs off the fence &amp; on board the trump train!
i've taken that main line train so often!
damn, somebody's dad took their tired ass, out-of-touch lecturing to another level.
that was soooooo incredibly tone-deaf and maybe even deliberately obtuse.
idk who told y'all to get turnt when you got a morning class 😩
lmfaoooo i wasn't turnt i was just maccinf
i'd like to point out that today is also the one-year anniversary of this happening at a gop presidential debate
ha. this was a precursor of all the gaffes to come.
if you aren't following 's lit af fantasy football thing, you're totally blowing it. it's incredible
damn, the teens kinda get it - i drafted my entire team based on attractiveness
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
it's not over. hillary can turn things around. she's not necessarily even losing though with co fading, maybe.
nice! i'm waiting and hoping for casper here... mainly for the mac management.
yeah casper is great.
"it's like a dude who saw a nine inch nails video and then saw the crow" talking about chris angel is killing me 😂

the "liberal media" and fox.
actually being from dallas, moving to kansas now living in san francisco working with hiv &amp; aids group. its all about testing.
most gay &amp; straight dont get tested until its mandatory or symptoms. health insurance &amp; not believing straight ppl can get it.

no one deserves *that*
likes to charge before sending stuff. at least didn't charge me while i was still waiting for processing 😡

where in the constitution does it say under age child should obey a document rather than their teacher? free isn't good enough?
harry reid: i don’t buy the polls — “donald trump is a fraud.”
go trip on your exercise machine again!
a company/service provider has no duty to make their customers money. corporations, like donald's, are in for themselves.
the difference between donald and hillary is that he is a businessman ($) and she's a politician (power).
i am repulsed by what the man stands for, you should be, too. xenophobia, racism, nativism, protectionism, nihilism, ... 1/
save ur hide. delete all the talking points and talk like you. all your phobias and ism's are just old, like a damaged player
goodbye. but you know what you did.
i certainly know what you think i did, which is not at all equivalent to what i actually did. i'm sorry your life is so sad.
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
still, co, nc, fla are all close enough they can turn blue. she needs great debates and hersurrogates and her need to dom media
once again, please support ramsey orta. here's the donations link to his official site:
thank you for this ❤️✊🏾💚
worth saying that birtherism isn’t just something trump did, it is entire the foundation of his political prominence.
&amp; more reasons he'll continue playing that card 2 his benefit until most americans start rejecting him. he's a conman

i cannot take the despair of that episode of danganronpa 3. i need a hug. i need hope.
question: i'm assuming this is apart of the overall narrative, but can't be considered an adaptation of the next game.

i hate 2 say oh that true crime book was great.anbody who reads them knows what i mean they are sad
appreciation. appreciate your loved ones, your many blessings, and appreciate your unbreakable will that gets you out of bed every morning.

you were not following the dem primary very closely. hrc wrapped it up long before the 'last day'
no, it is very much not. not as long as i have a tv show.
if bernie, warren, obama, michelle and hrc can control the media and have great debates, they will win.

the defense was like top 5 in the league that year. speak on that
the death of was "wrongful" enough for her family to get money, but not "wrongful" enough for someone to be held accountable.
i agree with you! when they are called to action it should be determined who will shoot instead firing unnecessary shots.
they hate you less
that's no longer a given.
this trump event was the most cynical thing i've ever seen a national candidate do, and i covered paul ryan.
yet, you were all there swooning so about what he'll be wearing, and what he will say. so many pimps so little news
trump now leads by more than 6 pts in national , ahead of clinton with likely voters in all age groups
why did you lie about sexual predator roger ailes, helping your campaign?
lmfao very brave .
only the brave survive

john king: “we just got played. we just got played. and voters can decide what to make of that."
anyone voting for is an idiot
psst: if you want the media to be more responsible—as i do—don’t make criticisms where you say all journalists are awful, or credulous, etc
will you settle for all major network "journalists" are credulous? anyone who appears on tv 3+ times a day is playing a role.
i hate this election.
it's actually the 110% worst one in our lifetime by a longshot.
hillary's intention is not only to bring black people "to heel", she plans to bring all of us to heel.
that skeleton is mad
nahhhh butcthat bitch is bad tho rt : 😂😂😂😂 niggas really said kash doll over bernice... i hate y'all for real lol
i love her bro but come on smh
yea if some girl came out the cut and called my bf handsome i'd keep my eyes on her 👀
right. but men pull a "oh thats you?!" &amp; then yal go play ball.
again, i agree to an extent. when a member of the ya community is genuinely hurt, or feel endangered in real life by death threats,
must be nice to have all of the benefits of a community without any concern for the safety of its members.
it's good (and dennis is super helpful), but ai still feels cold/abrasive/impersonable/wrong fit for users.
i hear you matt and hard at work. she is in good form though :)
here’s the thing: what do reporters do? protest him an not cover? he responds with “see? unfair!” plays his base.
i'm pretty sure there were few if any bridges left
i know, i support a bigot, hope i'm proud, i listen to what they both say and do, i will hold him accountable, ....
there was some rambling there. are you drinking during the day?

trump’s destructive validation of racists racial prejudice isn't 1 prob among many. it's a special category of wrong
yet it never exists unaccompanied.
some in the black community will not be satisfied, till they see white people getting lynched in america 😏
lumumba, then exile yourself from this great nation, spew your hatred elsewhere
are you guys ever going to enforce the "no smoking within 30ft of public entrances" rule, or do i have to die first?

i’m going to pass on that.
but is it a real thing? if so, ewwww.
i'm crying literally
that was the funniest shit ever dude we were crying. yan said fuck it and noah drank the shit too
pig trump was forced to admit obama was us born. so he had to do what he does best. lie.
is the candy trump used to attract the racists. they flocked to him like flies to shit.
lmfao how ima drive a caaahhrrr!!!??
rereading and dying 💯💯💯
rail wars is good actually

harry reid: i don’t buy the polls — “donald trump is a fraud.”
worse yet. if he's a fraud, what are they, his supporters?
nope, no you cannot. it's literally as if we're living in george orwell's 1984.
yo but its chill that barack was still cool enough with hillary to make her secstate even after she said he was born in africa
lol i don't have makeup on in that pic maybe that's why
lol ok that could be it. hope all is well homey
i need to do somethin with my hair
bleach blonde, lol
the birther issue is not important to americans, its only important to the left wing media because they're the ones that keep pushing it!
so true, because hillary has no other platform then to attack trump, she has no policy period, only more of the same
that seems primed for account takeovers.
not if it just uses the standard “forgot my password” machinery.
😭😭 someone get this guy a ticket 😭

stop it. not true!
i had a similarly funny dream about this time last year. lots of celebrity appearances in my dreams for some reason
these are great and also this makes me want to start writing down my dreams again
oh is that why they aren't speaking? somebody let their bravolebrity status go to her head?
say it isn't so. steph and brandi are not speaking??? i see a lot of pics of steph with carrie.
if you're still waiting for our episode, it's friday. go outside. have a drink. enjoy your day. ticc loves you and will be with you soon.
i'm going to kneel right here damnit
after a long rest, this is what comes back with - division!!
hillary's day was ruined by a very savvy and patriotic trump and the upper echelon of the military. she's run out.

she didn't text me to hang out so i am slightly sore about it
are you serious ...because you're clean! is all kinds of shadiness.
if that's an example of "cleanliness", i give up.
the more you know i guess :)
i mean, i guess that's kinda the idea. :3
the difference between donald and hillary is that he is a businessman ($) and she's a politician (power).
emotional rhetoric "adds" to the corporation's appeal (aapl and donald, for example). at the end of the day we're consumers
but this is all irrelevant. the fact is trump didn't allow the official pool to go with him, successfully avoiding answering any questions.
only correct thing to do in response is don't publish pictures from the 'photo opp' portion.
you going be one bruh from new york that used do this in 80's. we need this.
yeah his name was dapper dan. all the high end brands sued him n stole his ideas.
i told my mom to change her pro pic to one of her and i. instead she changes it to one of her &amp; sarah. close enough
actually i am in this photo....she just cropped me out
ahhh, that's why. most of mine are at 10

will you settle for all major network "journalists" are credulous? anyone who appears on tv 3+ times a day is playing a role.
i know, a lot of them are "pundits" or "correspondents" or just fucking chuck todd, but they're all part of an absurd theater.
the asian and russian made it an enterprise. either u dont make it out alive to get tested or the dont even allow raw.
unlike the movies, if u use drugs not theirs they dispose of you. u no good sick.
once emperor trump is crowned, you probably won't.
you don't seriously see him as an emperor do you? emperors were bloody, cruel murderers.

media liberals are raging because the "birther" issue was hillary's only ammo for the debates. trump just took it from her. haha.
the party's over for the media n dems.
so trump said clinton started the birther movement (she didn't), that he stopped it (he didn't) and that obama was born in us (he was).
which means the only thing that trump didn't lie about, was the lie that he himself made up and has propagated for years.
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .

oh nah. she an old jamaican woman? i'm taking back my offer lol
i have 3 stages of high: space fox, interstellar fox, and fish.
yeah you do have a pretty low tolerance like
🏙👄u were perfect! u founded the obama birther movement..that'll never go away&gt; lies
✅ &gt;facefacts! is not only the founder of obama's birther inquiry, she is a
did hillary clinton start the birther movement? - our fact check from may w
factcheck if is genius. the man truly is.
it really b breakin my heart lmao playin wit action figures but talkin tough sis
like you wouldnt smack them right out those yeezy's that they swears makes them bout it hahaha.
taco trucks on every street corner? calls that 'absolutely delicious.'
now that is funny 😀lol
happy friday! what book will you be reading this weekend?
hunger of memory....perfect read for a teacher in washington heights.
a certain video game company ive always wanted to work for emailed me back for an interview after i just started my new job....
you gotta take that interview
good luck and god bless
yeah follow up insult with your hypocritical self-righteous piety
happy friday! is ! be sure to tune in at noon!
just changed channels. roginsky unable to move past birther. she's obnoxious!
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
"lie", you mean, donald. the word is "lie".
so are foundations
good foundations give out over 80% of the proceeds (ckinton's). corporations give out dividends to their shareholders.
producers are business people. their job is to generate revenue. they don't care about the integrity of the content.
did you catch the recent celeb jeopardy? michael steele, lara logan - neither of them knew current political events that were 1/
he handed her his book of stamps--he's the kind of man who keeps stamps in his writing desk. she peels one off &amp; sticks it to the postcard.
he says dryly "must be nice to be so rich." "what do you mean?" she says. "you used an entire stamp for a postcard," he says.
that's the right approach, to be fair.
you would think revoking press credentials would have done something but...so yeah, this will be all forgotten soon
cubs were a better tm. bull durham's error was huge. much much bigger mistake than buckner's.
flannery smoked that ball through leon's legs. buckner's was a slow roller detroit unbeatable ws that year. 35-5
no, i think we all have those feelings. seeing 🐍, 🕷, or 🦂🐜 cause me many issues. esp at night!
i can never think about the victims. makes my heart hurt. unfathomable
good i got worried. thanks for the update
lol wow i miss your humor
julie andrews hasn't changed much since the sound of music lol
the hills are alive
my phone keeps saying it cannot connect to itunes store, so my apps won't download. grrrr
same here. 😑
eric trump circa january 2017: i had no idea i was tweeting the launch codes and i never heard of defcon 1.
for his fancy-dan education he's not too bright.
look what we found. cc:
good times you killed it that night dawg
the election is a big distraction from what we should be doing with our time and energy!
incredibly huge distraction, waste of time and resources...
it’s always sunny in san jose, stefan ;) what are you doing out there?
almost always… tell u at insight .. flying out today
update: trump, who long trumpeted obama birth conspiracy theories, flip-flops and says pres. obama was born in us.
i didn't know that the "flip-flop" rules of presidential politics applied to . msm says they don't.
just yesterday, trump again refused to say with his own words that the president was born in the united states.
no no now now transparecy...your campaign said it first...
thank you so much teresa! 😘😘
your welcome! i'm excited for you. what a journey since b-school conference, 2013 in nyc! ☀️
next to papis gas station, by el poblano
hann good shit dutch master flex god 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽
riding you get daily evidence of how dire the is in exceedingly disturbed person on the 14r i’m on 😢
a very common occurrence on the 6
truth to that. i'm actually curious if there are more boats being bought now.
we bought one. lol
aww your avi with your boothang is so cute!
thank you cat💜
last night was unreal. feels weird to have a team this good offensively. fitz was unconscious.
ecstatic! minus the hangover lol. fitz is the man . my auto correct capitalizes that and melo. lmao
great example of asking tough questions to both sides. here with a trump spox and a hillary surrogate:
:we all know that megan kelly is one of the most vindictive network talking heads. hates trump 4 outing her
the calm before the storm. let us know how that long run goes.
will do, i'll be running it with you guys at the 57th st store here in nyc
in my 76yrs i have learned ..please do not try to convince a liberal with facts. it confuses them.
you're right, it nevef works. you have to turn their own words back on them. just ask them questions, they usually cant answer
sitting on a flight- if anyone has a question shoot it my way &amp; will do my best to answer....
why no red/white scrimmage? is there going to be an open practice at msg?
to come back home for the weekend or just stay at monmouth 🤔
girl stop playing
is this leading to a lot of time unaccounted for?
more like matching drive times to receipt and toll tag times. showing where he could have been and at what time--lp
i could lead you to several articles but you'd most likely dismiss them because you're a reality denier
oh really? show me evidence. evidence. that's reality. accusations, opinion, twitter posts are not evidence. you got it? i'll wait.
yo chris wanna get boba guys after you pick up your phone?? (i need a boba emoji...)
did you pick it up yet? where you at? my pick up time was at 8:30... but i just woke up. heading to the 🍎 store in 5
a tale of two push notifications.
those 4 minutes made for a much more enticing headline... worth it?
that's not a zarya skin tho
i'm trying to help you not be that guy, work with me here
ok who’s selling me their 256gb jet black 7 plus?!
are you running a fingerprint forensics lab? cuz...well, you know. ja tu sabe
did you catch the recent celeb jeopardy? michael steele, lara logan - neither of them knew current political events that were 1/
outside their talking points...even when they were topically related. it was embarrassing. /2
even the hairy ones called dave?
ctfu hellz no
how is there not a hip-hop hypothesis?
there is! check the part about kanye and backpack rap.
idk but all i know is that it's pretty wack ☹️️
why'd you freakin post it then 🙄
we're so excited for your event in palo alto on september 29!

how do i get one? is this another one for ?
i'll email you a copy, alison. i have it scanned. i printed some for spx just to start to talk to people.
thank you.i will review it on my blog. do you have a contact name to request a review copy of the exhibition catalog?
for press inquiries:
lol i been with my dude on and off since 2006 (10 years) but officially 5.. now we live together and got a baby.. real shit 😍
that is real shit. whatever is meant for you will always come back to you
of they do. it's a world. it up to the game and stop being when things get
emeraldy confused by these blanket stalagmites
didn't get to that yet! but sheesh!!!!!
i am sorry about this julia. lmao
illegal immigrants in north carolina are demanding free college tuition
isn't that interesting. i guess if the other clown making millions can disrespect the flag, these idiots can claim whatever.
where are you on university today? looking for my poutine fix! 😊
1344 university ave
no, i think we all have those feelings. seeing 🐍, 🕷, or 🦂🐜 cause me many issues. esp at night!
it was getting a bit dark so i switched off 2 a fiction and then linda thompson book.needed a break
when in doubt, always go with jell-o gelatin snacks. made with real fruit juices.
stop promoting your cancerous products.
it takes courage, regardless of what it may cost you, to say no this is no longer acceptable. powerful stuff. thank you .
but she stands for the national anthem of a country that is on the human rights watchlist.
no one cares. hillary's sinking like a rock. it's over.
simply untrue. she's still leading with 6 weeks. see you at the debates assuming you're allowed up from
president obama says he's 'not that shocked' birther issue is back
the sharia law muslim brotherhood, anti american asshole thing will never go away!
$20 tickets for all my us shows today until 10pm! use code: amirnatural where prompted
😕 got our tickets full price but hey we support you man
do you think it's feasible to slow down, though? we consume content faster than ever it's crazy.
i do. i consistently refer back to good content producers for recipes&amp;general reading enjoyment😻. i drift away if quality ⬇️.
we're so excited for your event in palo alto on september 29!
(or at least they did in 1975)
but why are they all wearing dress shirts to pull a dog out of a hole? via
maybe they're all just wearing "shirts"
no one cares. hillary's sinking like a rock. it's over.
your man's crotch
watching reunion episode the entire team: (looking stunning)
it was on again?! i missed it the 1st time 😢
i didnt go to private school but know alot of friends that did and came out to do horrible life choices and didnt reach their full potential
i think that has to do more with the friends they kept or the choices they personally made, however...
watch your mouth that's my girl
my fault i thought she was single
fox news get this angry nasty bitch julie r off your show 12pm. many of us despise this witch. i changed the channel again!
yep, same here, shes awful
on top of the thoughtful, subtle way imagines robot subversives, the show is also a western about the horrors of colonization.
does it have roman world and medieval world in it? who is playing dick van patten?
mt shasta from above.
welcome home
track 13: 95 is the new 20
track 14: album longer than my 🍆
happy friday. pre book a with me today at &amp; get 5 extra mins. free. don't miss out.

i read the light between oceans. fantastic book
the only bluetooth ones i have are studios and they’re too much for casual tv stuffs :(
decent bluetooth headphones start around $15 - $20 now. i’ve got some from amazon that aren’t bad.
cuz the person that posted it only took like one of me 😶
stop being selfish i always take a bunch of you 😒
top clinton surrogate in 2008 "repeatedly suggests that barack obama is a native of somalia"
trump finally admitted what everyone with an iq above 40 knew, that his racist effort to legitimatize obama failed.
before michelle obama, what livecast song would get stuck in your head over and over?
havana , robba and my next my back
it means that the chickenhawk militarist had his draft status of 1a mysteriously reclassified to 4f in 1968.
had he not used his father's influence to obtain reclassification you can be sure that he was headed for a section 8.
he says dryly "must be nice to be so rich." "what do you mean?" she says. "you used an entire stamp for a postcard," he says.
"it's only a postcard so you only need half a stamp." she looks at him for a while. then they both burst out laughing (because she knew.)
donald trump takes credit for “finishing” the conspiracy theory he helped start via
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
i feel like “entrepreneur” is one of those labels you shouldn’t be allowed to give yourself like “fascinating” or “brilliant.”
thank you! it's almost always a red flag when i see it on a linkedin profile.
think you would appreciate this! for real, not mocking. to kevin's point about chain familiarity
also i'm aware this is not chili's but similar sentiment :)
and we no longer believe the ap anyway.
bad, even terrible attempts to cover this insanity on social. yet ap is still the standard bearer
we maybe can't climb a mountain - but not even can take it's beauty from us join &gt;
hello love cheers . . . .
"thanks but i'll pass" "can you recommend a better colleague?" "no it's my beat" "so you'll take the meeting" "no i'll pass" "can you rec--"
pr bosses still never learn that no means no
are you people serious? the man is fucking crazy
trump is a saint up against the most corrupt manipulative habitual lying manic to ever run 4potus
don't matter - both are not worth tweeting about -- wasting our energy. both are in it for themselves.
correct! in different manners.
thanks for hosting our group today . looks like lots of yummy nutritious food in the pantry!
always a pleasure having the team in to volunteer! thanks to everyone helping make our free pantry better than ever
we disagree on his performance last year. and yes, last week's loss stunk
he wasn't "great". but he made plays. finding a qb is hard
watching reunion episode the entire team: (looking stunning)
seems like i missed the reunion again 😢
i didnt go to private school but know alot of friends that did and came out to do horrible life choices and didnt reach their full potential
public schools only need the kids to "pass" while private schools need the kids to excel... they'll push your kids more
update: fled. i yelled "where are the details of your charitable donations!" at volume of man warning of volcanic eruption.
thank you for staying on this issue!
oak plan is out there. no public money outside infrastructure &amp; can't give you coli because a's have long lease
it is what it is. you can't pretend there's more that could be done given the circumstances.
what did he do
he had donald trump on his show, in front of his all-black band, and treated him like his best friend
. you must have flunked economics at fordham (when you didnt get into penn). your plan is jibberish
the differences between mc &amp; djt is mc's money is real &amp; djt's isnt his is borrowed or fake calculations
thanks for the tweet!
it's a *great* piece. important and very well written. keep up the great work!
you may want to check the delegate count, because you are wrong.
clinton won the primary by nearly 1,000 delegates.
shout out to this harlem cafe concealing their 'b' rating as a 'brunch' sign
at least it's not brun c h
did his daughter call your office?
i'm not gonna say who. great people though. some of the best, smartest people.
that's bastion not mei
bastion is the cancer, mei is chemo
i have a big surprise for you guys. join me on facebook live in a bit to celebrate.
i assume you announce to not endorse trump! what a great day it would be for such a statement!
wow thank you
there's no thanks necessary, keeping being yourself, i like it
why on earth?
doing something different i guess.
oppression is profitable
white supremacy is profitable
sorry but he lost me by giving that monster airtime in a fun-loving way.
yeah he lost me last night to. i know jf is a non political guy but he glorified a hateful racist and bigot
yo you talking crazy right now chill out
nigga fuck you. you and her can hum on me
trump admits birtherism is a lie. so, was he lying when said in '11 his "detectives" found "unbelievable" things about obama birth certif?
. trump probably has not been truthful abt anything since he learned the art&amp; potential profits of lying!
krauthammer: trump is a brilliant strategist &amp; he is playing the msm like a fiddle &amp; it is working
hillary is still sliding, run out of diatribes against trump, still doesnot dwell on policy; 23min speech to bash dt
he had donald trump on his show, in front of his all-black band, and treated him like his best friend
the internet is not happy about it
this is amazing
i love this
oh, wow! you ordered all the right things for sure. are you a san jose native?
san francisco native but i'm always driving all over the buy to try new foods!
no rambling, focused like a laser beam, sick of hypocrisy, lack of a balanced accountabilty by the media on both sides.
first time you've ever said that. the racism that this campaign brought to the surface is scary. fed on hate and fear.
help! there’s a really cute boy in my chem lecture with a life of pablo shirt. i am screaming
offer to suck his dick i'm sure he will be down 4 it
poor anthony ...so delusional
don't be mad because la was blocked
great, thank you. i still miss my mum (i think one always does) and id like another perspective.
oh alison, i didn't know ❤️❤️❤️
that nj trip sucked so bad but we had so many laughs!
fucking donna called me michelle obama. fucking jungle hoe
we consume stories in headlines and statements. this'll show up as trump is not a birther, and people not paying attention will take it.
now i want to hear him admit that president obama is a christian.
we are proud to work with , , and to achieve plastic free seas.
plastic free seas. could be an ad for extraterrestrial tourists.
playback: messes up ’s hair
so it's not a toupee but a horrible hair transplant. now time 2 release his medical records &amp; taxes
we're on the buses heading towards vandenberg. hold on to your butts!!
launch time window is 11:30 - 11:45 am pst
do you think it's feasible to slow down, though? we consume content faster than ever it's crazy.
example: watched ur chickpea nibble scope. couldn't make it that day, but it's in my head &amp; pulled out can to do this weekend.
12 pm. . joining , , and .
you ruined todays show with your big fat m
lemme not get things out of perspective. im always grateful for my life and the things i have going on but today i'm just real fuckin mad
listen, i can make all those boxes in your parking lot disappear inside of two hours, i can send a guy
ooooooh she want a michael, she don't do jermaines (hehe)
prince with the hundreds yeah, purple rain (hehe)
donald trump ends his longstanding embrace of birtherism: "president obama was born in the united states. period"
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
"it's only a postcard so you only need half a stamp." she looks at him for a while. then they both burst out laughing (because she knew.)
they were good friends. but when i see people saying they don't get involved, i always remember that line: "must be nice to be so rich."
oh god yes.
lmao. just as well that i'll be in the air and ignorant for the next 10 hours.
a truth placed in a sandwich of two lies doesn't make a hero. it makes it a sh*t sandwich. (concerning trump birther announcement)
lol at the msm being trolled for free publicity. he plays all of you like a fiddle and you keep coming back for more.
just ran over a squirrel. not a great feeling. it had been a really long time.
better than swerving, but, yeah, never a good feeling. i'll pour some out for our furry friend.
so after 2 months of test of this mysterious huge mass on my dog.. i just found out she doesn't have cancer! i'm so happy. thank u jesus!!!
won't he do it?!?! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾
[new] creative spaces tv | nyc street artist mark samsonovich! watch now &gt;

*spoilers*i thought phi phi should have won the lsfyl and katya should have gone home b4 alyssa!(im gonna die now!)
nope, not when roxxxy andrews is still in the game. hate all you want, but she deserved to go home over alyssa.
white supremacy is profitable
incarcerating black/latinx/indiginous peoples is profitable
you can just feel the drill and stuff. like no stop that
oh i dont think you understand. he opened up my entire gum and drillled like a 2 inch titanium rod into it. it was lit
mqotd: what's more tragic? the slaughter of cattle for consumption. or the euthanization of an over populated system of orphan house pets?
either one works for me
thanks model papi 😎 was inspired by all your nyfw work for this last shoot
means the world to me! 😬
hey and - you've given trump complete control of your air. he's playing you and you succumb. proud of yourselves???
he finished, huh?
how much did you pay for this? it looks bland as hell lol
i didn't. i'm a patient. if i did i'd ask for my money back
lol!! yea, me too!! hey i like your new profile pic.
yes i like your new pic. i need a new one. somebody tweeted me that i was like a thousand years old
why did trump wait to address "birther" issue today? "to promote his hotel," says
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
who's in san francisco?? bout to catch this plane out there for the weekend! with
tap in! i'm here for you ! you need some 🌲🍁😤?
this is neat !
i have had this on my phone for ages. :p
oh god yes.
and properly liquored up. :)
yep. plenty of time to revert to their typical stance.
watch msnbc for the largest gaff of the day. they tend to revert to sensationalism when ratings slump during the midday.
i get what he is trying to say, but geez...take the temperature of the room.
what's the take? injuries are bad and jets are really good?
what if you just happened to chill in the store with a group of like minded folks in an orderly fashion?

i just thought up an iphone 7 joke
ahahaha i cannot wait to hear your joke. is it about the home button? the scratches? the headphone jack? ahahaha. i cannot wait.
just in: trump: "president barack obama was born in the united states, period"
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
omfg what is this hahahha
i found it in my time hop 😂😂😂
holy fuck! i had no idea that footlocker was still in business. i haven't seen one since 1998
are you serious
nope, not when roxxxy andrews is still in the game. hate all you want, but she deserved to go home over alyssa.
but it's still despicable to drag phi phi for the same decision alaska made.
spent 1.5hrs cleaning the deck and that little dirt pile is all that is left-- covered the whole place-!!!!

a mass refusal to engage in prison labor began on september 9, the anniversary of the 1971 attica prison uprising.

most of these people are hillary's non deplorable crowd that can't afford an id in order to vote for her. aren't we all fucked up?
all i got was this jet black rock
i’m pretty jealous over here. though i chose matte, so mine will be a much less shiny rock.
so what the article is saying is that aa want to remain poor, unemployed and live in unsafe neighborhoods that are falling apart!
no, but thanks for sharing how ignorant you are about how "aa"'s live. reminds me of someone you're voting for.
after several abortive, experimental attempts, i've worked out a workflow in maya for modular walls that isn't nuts.
now i can be like, productive again.... eeesh. :)
you guys plan on watching this?????
yeah. it looked real cool from the trailer
wow. cnn: the pool tv producer was physically restrained from going on trump's hotel tour, to prevent any questions.

sour beer + peach vodka? we've never thought of that combo. did you come up with that yourself?
yeah. it was good. we dod it until the bar ran out of peach eddy
btw, saw your ig post re: abandoned twitter. ditto! i don't use it cos everytime i visit &amp; ask "is anyone home?" no one answers
hey girl, i see you!
any dude wearing fubu in 2016 is definitely not afraid to smack you in the face in front of everyone.
i still wear coogi.
donald trump publicly says president obama was born in us
birth certificate and hair are real, he is a fake.
why no red/white scrimmage? is there going to be an open practice at msg?
sorry i didn't see theo's question. good luck!
yes i like your new pic. i need a new one. somebody tweeted me that i was like a thousand years old
if you guys watch rhobh you will know why yolanda got divorced. holy crap, david f0rster is an ass.
what question are you talking about?
curious what a "twitlonger" is.
hooked a good one, see you guys later.
great timing!! see you tonight!
they were good friends. but when i see people saying they don't get involved, i always remember that line: "must be nice to be so rich."
"must be nice, to be rich enough not to worry about my money."
totally agree, it just sucks when i see things like that :/
imagine how much it sucks to see poc die because of their stereotypes
court u look so good with this color and this whole look just holy glo up wowie 😻

america is one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. not just for people who look or worship a certain way.

is marc jacobs even still legit in the fashion world? i'm confused.
i remember someone said 'marc jacob is hoodrat couture.' is that twitter ignorance or is that really how he's viewed??
breaking: trump admits obama born in u.s. but falsely blames clinton for starting rumors
this is your headline? the media is being duped
huzzah. enjoy! when you get back, want to watch my kids so i can go on a bender?
yeah, why not? :) also, let's go !
why does he have flowers
arzaylea. she was also posting about him yesterday so maybe it was an special day for them or something?
i mean - it should be disqualifying to only just accept that the current president was born in the us
given the length and fervor of his birtherism, he also can't imagine he won't have to prove his convenient new acceptance.
i’m creating a think tank to discover smart cities, would you post your tweet also at ?
i will check it out later...very busy at the moment.
that song got me the first time we heard it and it still does.

i love fahrenthold's reportorial transparency here. we can all follow along!
i'm guessing it'll go to the "trump foundation."
i mean - it should be disqualifying to only just accept that the current president was born in the us
as there is a difference between "accept that i've lost this fight" and "accept the truth i was fighting against."
typical hilliary acolyte. you want the same obama media (i mean cheerleaders) we've had for last 8 years?
or do we go back to the good ole days when republicans were last in charge. trump will be g.w. bush iii.
have gone up drastically in the last 8 years, time for a change,
they must really trust him based on the support he's getting. white people wanna choose who's best for black people. right
the whole dreads thing you guys should be attacking marc jacobs instead of the models you're just desperate to drag gigi and kendall stfu
they're just
this is so bad, they're already running 1h behind.

saudis do nothing but visit obama in the white house for tea with a media blackout. arrest obama now!
you must not have seen the movie san andreas
i actually did!! i'll take an earthquake over a hurricane, though
breaking: trump admits obama born in u.s. but falsely blames clinton for starting rumors
when are you going to come out with the headline "trump is a birther"
the misreporting of this trump shit is alarming, giving that, you know, people are paid to deeply understand and interpret these things.
no wonder people who aren't paid to be skeptical are misled not only by politicians but also lazy writers and "social media professionals"
i have it but haven't read it yet as not sure. i'm glad you said that!! thanks.
oh great book, well written and tragic story. i will say, get tissues ready.

wow! how progressive we have become when patriotism is shunned!
disparities even exist across public schools in different boroughs.
absolutely agree. in cali the quality of ed between districts was directly correlated w the socio-economic status of the area.
trump today: 270 words on his hotel. 67 words on birtherism.
so the media should just run the hotel portion of the event...
good morning yankees fans! new day make the best of it. no 😂 in baseball we will be back! go yankees

cool, let me know how it comes out...
maybe i used it the wrong way but please explain the right way, thanks...
try to find god and how you can be saved, what did god do for you to save you? it's your choice, work it out..do the math
trump belittles harry reid's injury, gets deserved response ➡️ by via
the retarded left is using corrupt old harry reid to attack trump?
non-contagious bacterial pneumonia is not even a real diagnosis. this is getting ridiculous.
who is that? the pants are too long, must be someone shorter.
could ggg put 45k in the dallas stadium against someone like smith (as far as popularity goes)?
no he's not a mexican. now even floyd can do that.
sean tell me thats not true.
sorry sana, i just found out about these guys and pizza this morning. did you know pizza was not invented in italy?!
lol that's a double standard all in itself. but very true
also, dont forget those who don't even seek treatment. that the problem! my biggest issue with it all.
no child should have to say goodbye to their parents every morning not knowing if mom or dad will be there when they get home.
shouldn't mom and/ or dad be at work? i guess you are cultivating a venezuela style downgrade for our nation
i love "openpower" because it has the most unique, creative uses of the word 'open' ever conceived in history
probably mean open as in “not requiring a management engine” or other blobs. they mentioned about it at the conf
nrel showed integrating 30% wind+solar reduces operating costs without radical changes

i'm at 45% on my 6s plus 🙃
"think different"
also pre-ordered but i have no use for my current phone so doing this allows me to leave my 6 and save 250~
all you have to do is google it and you'll see that the donors and supporters started it. doesn't matter, trump wins easily
the fact that you think "trump wins easily" is all the proof i need to know where ur "proof' that hrc started it comes from. lol.
i know it's been a while since you worked here but it's still rivals, not bleacher report.
sorry, i had heard it was going to be a bleacher video, not a bleacher-style video. i'll get that changed.
ya it's super hard, but they can never stop you from standing up, but they can stop listening
yup, so as an individual who wants to effect change, you need to be in a space that allows it, among other things.
you're a legend

"president barack obama was born in the united states. period. now, we all want to get back to making america strong &amp; great again." - trump
smart move!
send me questions for today's video!
when are we expecting new music from you?
no but i've had my gums and teeth drilled. all that stuff just bothers me when it's not numb. like i said i hate the dentist
so have i and i hate that too but im telling you this was that x300
you're just a side
calls ricky to plot
trump: 'pres. barack obama was born in the united states, period. now, we all want to get back to making american strong and great again.'
okay, we conceded to the convention, and presumption. so, what does that mean in a "borderless world"?
fictional left right argument fail!
again these are just empty calories for the brain. you are the ideal trump voter
maybe i used it the wrong way but please explain the right way, thanks...
don't have an unbelieving heart to reject the grace of god in christ, it's an individuals choice.. that's what i think
and one year since we met!!! xxx miss ya lynn
yasssssss! fun night for all! 😉✌❤🎶
press 'shocked' that trump treats them as the cheap whores they are..
this coming from a member of the tin foil hat club/, who until today, didn't think obama was a us citizen.
re: journalists in my twitter feed right now saying "the media will no longer let trump get away with this."
time to hammer this 1 in &amp; every other lie has uttered 2con &amp; win the primaries. media owes usa the truth!
if you have two breakfast tacos in each hand, that's a balanced breakfast.

why can't you get reserve?
the app is now crashing for me on startup every time. have reinstalled. anyone have any help? 😡
thanks for reporting this. can you give us any more information? os version and device?
what are you talking about? the tweet calls it bogus. this report, like others, debunks it
where does "given prominence" come from? it's (passively) about media/journalism - what you do. also, that lede/hed awful.
and here is the clinton campaign's latest focus...will it work? how will donald trump handle?
this is so weak and yet you all try to make a big deal about voters don't give a hoot about👎👎 try doing your job just for kicks
behold, the iphone 7 plus. matte black finish is so nice 😎 👍🏼

do i have to sleep in the dirt for three days? because i can't handle life without showering lol
3) and no one else is in the room to help. just me, you and a broadcast crew. deal ?
you don't even need the broadcast crew... just do it on the interwebs, the smart channels will pick it up.
let’s just say i have a hard time accepting abby wambach of any sort of arbiter of “sportsmanship”.
haha that makes sense
"we have a chance to show that comprehensive immigration reform isn’t just the smart thing to do—it’s what the american people demand."
i would run it by the millions of unemployed blacks first. or are the non deplorable too good for work?
trump saying at this point "uh, i'm not a birther" has all the weight of jet li coming out to hold a presser saying he's no longer chinese
he's all incredulous about it too. "president obama was born in the us, period." asshole, we knew that. you're the birther.
hey meet ... i know you two will have lots to share with each other including love of the nice guys
thanks! very nice to meet you. can we connect? i followed you please dm your email
i'm thinking about making something like this but idk
i would do it if i was you.
gucci, marc jacobs, louis vuitton, hilfiger keep proving their racism and we keep on supporting them. go ahead.

the corrupt left is so mad at this deplorable tweet they are coming to get you with this chick.....
"barack obama was born in america, plain and simple, and donald trump owes him and the american people an apology." -
distraction. trump can apologize after you hillary, apologize for benghazi and your email scandals!
oooooo lol oh so it's definitely bland lol
i spit that shit out on the first bite. lol
sour beer + peach vodka? we've never thought of that combo. did you come up with that yourself?
mmhmm... it was pretty good, too.
i really don't think we celebrated colin powell enough this week.
we didn't lol colin was a real one
i'm just the moderator ;) also have withings represented, so broader conversation.
as 's noted, open has cost. needs compatibility w/business model, industry rep important! 👍
the app is crashing upon launch on ios 10. would like to see some affirmation, that you are working on fixing that!
can you let us know which type of device you’re seeing the crash on?
is it "i ate so many scrambled eggs this morning that i feel sick" or "i ate so much scrambled eggs this morning that i feel sick"?
many. each of the eggs you ate was scrambled.
of it helps, this has been my phone since i got it
never 👏🏽 install 👏🏽 from 👏🏽 icloud.
oh! bhule gechilum. lol. but then aro koto lok ke je koto kichu bole, hope all of them r true! 😉
what i say is 'true', never knew how to do 'buttering' to people other than to a toast😉😜
ashleigh banfield on cnn is completely fed up with trump's "birther crap" 🔥🔥
how about rest of trump's crap?!!!
some plans for ios 10 compatibility? the app doesn't load anymore on my updated ipad pro...
we’re looking into it now.
oh well i'm sorry. sounds awful. the sound of the drill is terrible tbh lol.

where'd you get game-by-game stats?
agreed. gulbuddin hekmatyar will do anything for a buck...or a million.
you are very correct. thanks for your input. hig should never to be trusted. ghani is fooling himself.
that's the nicest thing people say.
the nicest thing people say to me is "get a life you libtard hater" haha

he ended up cheating who wants it
lemme get it for free thanks :)
some level backgrounds before we add lighting &amp; shadows
this is pre-lighting? looks sick!
yes, it's a muslim designer including hijabs in her line. not even comparable to what marc jacobs did.
what's wrong with models wearing fake dreadlocks at a fashion show?
supporting families with paid family leave, earned sick days, and affordable child care isn’t a luxury—it’s a necessity.
being able to get a nice house, a nice car, eat well, stay warm should be the result of my hard work. not taxes
basicalllly. you get out at 10? or are we meeting at 10?
get out at 10, we'll scoop you
yes yes yes!!!!!!!!
and treatment free! ppl are lazy. they'll stand in line for anything else but proper health care.
i miss you too! we'll have to find each other tonight!
yes!! do you have one of the express entry tickets or are you ga?
enough of allowing trump to play by different rules. if he can't conform, then he's out. what's wrong with that?
is making a mockery of our political system &amp; the must put a halt!
, oh 3 guys that fight for social justice, i feel honored, thanks. they are looked upon highly in the aa community. thanks
i knew it!! goodbye. not only are you the enemy of minority's everywhere, but you profit by further enslaving the uninformed
oh well i'm sorry. sounds awful. the sound of the drill is terrible tbh lol.
but i haaaaaate the sound of the regular drill like that high pitched shit omg it makes my whole body shiver
well of course you did, verizon actually knows what it is doing. did you use iphone upgrade program?
no just used a relatives verizon upgrade, still using it on t-mobile though. just got delivered.
i heard.. he is a comedian so what does he expect? he can dish it out but he can't take it back?
i think she hit to close to the truth! lol pretty much the sheltered life, real world, he can't handle lol
just a lady and her garbage fire.
that is so gd great.
if you want time youll make time.
exactly! had to learn that the hard way, us women are stubborn lol
only 53% of adults are “extremely proud” to be americans—a 17% decline since 2003.
is the concept of nation an obsolete protection of medieval mercantilism? should nations still have borders?
if u watch the show, u know how important the iron throne is
the throne was supposedly forged by the dragon of the first targaryen king. he used fire to melt 1000 swords into a chair
. honestly digging it so far. question is are you guys liking all these videos in your feed?
the only way it could be more spammy was if i were at the empire state building! actually not far from!.. ;p
yup i remember reading up on him. companies was really hot because he was accumulating more than companies put together.
he was fa sho eating. all the big time drug dealer fucked wit bruh
sure the press are mad at trump he has expose them as what they are puppets for hillary.
yeah when they show videos of him proving he is a liar, he makes them look stupid, right.
i'll miss relentlessly good cheer on weekends! fun &amp; honor to share the stage with her these 3 yrs.
wish sara was staying😥
it's just a completely different style coming from him. art for sure though.
i'll give you that - he's evolved a bit from the "knock knock" days.
harry reid: i don’t buy the polls — “donald trump is a fraud.”
no 1n their right mind buys polls.so called minorities/poc r rarely polled.remember polls right b4 2012 election when potus won again!
.1) $10mm to the charity of your choice if you let me interview you for 4 hrs on your policies and their substance.
i so want to take u up on this. but he'll never do it. he doesn't stand a chance up against u
spending $31 each week on a metro card pisses me off.
i spend that on a cab everyday lmao
tweet every day with the confidence of a man with 34 followers shouting at a celebrity.
the amount of people crying about their follower count here amuses me.
957 replaced their best show with jt the brick?... this ain't 1997
over tinkering can be a bad thing knbr are licking their chops
ep5: , on &amp; what it means for exits
that was fun. things in ipo world are starting to get interesting, october update?
well of course you did, verizon actually knows what it is doing. did you use iphone upgrade program?
had the opportunity to iphone upgrade this am but 5th ave store is a mess rn and it's a worse deal than 400$ flat
exclusive: drops diss track :
mmh he need me these girls mine they wont fuck with him
being able to get a nice house, a nice car, eat well, stay warm should be the result of my hard work. not taxes
you are pimping for votes by taking advantage of those that work hard
the throne was supposedly forged by the dragon of the first targaryen king. he used fire to melt 1000 swords into a chair
here's the show's depiction: pretty badass, scary
"hillary is mentally ill and not fit to serve as president" - her mental... via
: hilarity is mentally ill, as are those in the media who lick frau cltntlon's boots.
boys do the same, it's wrong in both ways.
this is true. 😅
the unreleaded somg they played at the concert
holy shit ur right
was the fallon thing that bad?
yes fallon is spineless
"there are a lot of very, very evil people...we have to be prepared. we have to keep our country so great and so strong." -
yup. and open borders just invite them to come here!
at the end of 2013.. it sounds like a while.. but as i've found.. and you know.. you always have your mum.
it sounds like yesterday. i think it will always.
dear , trump saying anything about birtherism is not a "big announcement." please, stop.
it's all about eyeballs.
a lovely... fifth alternate. (sic) “trust the duchess” &amp;
she may not be an actress, but she is a fierce queen!
it might be too soon to speak but stef &amp; her dude might be the only solid couple i know. ive looked all my life.
we love you dude 🤘🏽😭 ugh we appreciate the love!!
questioning the place of birth for eligibility to be president = racist? only for obama? nobody screamed racist when they questioned cruz
is canada a state?
i've talked about it before but this is the year i host a henny &amp; hot chocolate onesie function
that doesn't sound appetizing. i'll bring champagne for myself.
wow i use to be cute
that shirt lmao😭
hey guyz 🤘😁🤘🍻
good day simon cheers 🍻🍻🍻
here's the show's depiction: pretty badass, scary
this is not what it should look like! the author has said again and again that his version of the iron throne does not look like this
the thing w marc jacobs is you're inherently operating out of a place of ignorance. humble yourself and apologize.
it's fashion... nothing wrong with it. it's the people that are offended who are ignorant. fake dreadlocks are everywhere.
all you have to do is google it and you'll see that the donors and supporters started it. doesn't matter, trump wins easily
if we can attribute what "supporters" say to the candidate, then according to david duke your guy is a real white supremacist.
wait. the verizon model has all the t-mobile bands this year?
according to everything i have read yes
"this is a time where we need our military, perhaps, more than ever." -
a strong and well equipped military!
today is our gender appointment👶🏽
omg im so excited for you !!! what do you want ??
bernie sanders is in new paltz and i'm stuck at shoprite☹️☹️☹️
i don't see the issue
you 'walked' past it, that counts in my book as exercise.
the donald trump routine
lmao! i be feelin' like that sometimes. keep lovin' each other maaaan. blessings y'all way! prosper.
thankful for people like you 💓🤘🏽
trump today: 270 words on his hotel. 67 words on birtherism.
the way he speaks is just....off. like he's had a mental break or something
at the end of 2013.. it sounds like a while.. but as i've found.. and you know.. you always have your mum.
it's like having and losing at the same time.
the best would be to do one on all the top alternates
😭 have a good one guys!
do you think owes president an apology? (cc: )
no. absolutely not!
soccer season 🙏🏼⚽️
when's cuddle season?
sunday, 9/25... walk💜, eat, drink and win💙💚
our plan isn't to go back to carlow but, we'll be cheering them on! &amp; any that want to walk our more than welcome
how sad it is: trump admits obama born in us and that's considered news.
the dumbing down of america is complete. trump has made being ignorant chic; a badge of honor. the philistines may rule america!
i think it also depends on the public school. in mine the teachers &amp; counselors were very strict &amp; always pushing us
smaller is better too
when you've lost you're confederate flag but still want everyone to know you're a racist
still haven't seen a hillary sticker or sign anywhere in my blue state?
change with the seasons
4 seasons buddy

i read the first paragraph and closed the page
so far only westworld, but i've only seen the first two episodes.
they do have a lot to play with if they choose to. yul brynner in ww scared the shit out of me when i was 6-years-old btw.
very nice! how long of a run did you get to take this time?
thanks! we ran for an hour :)
oh, great then! so, what makes you think that this wasn't what bishop oyedepo meant? tell me...
he clearly said "not once saved always saved" that is not scriptural, once you're born again you can't be condemned again
michael kors. marc jacobs still has standing as far as apparel/influence
oooh ok ok. thanks
😂😂😂😀😂 ohhh god!! this is awesome
he forgot to add the third line :p
a space for "no" is a data point, but will starve without the larger landscape. recently i &lt;3 "aligned autonomy" label
orgs who say you've got that open space without the other components won't be sustainable. that's my kvetch.
when you thought you sent one ☹️
when he didn't
his campaign people have said this before. he wouldn't say it today. so this is not news until he says it.
you got your answer asshat
i don't watch any of the whores on fox
got rid of more right anchors think judge pirro and hannity get axed
wait. the verizon model has all the t-mobile bands this year?
i'm using a verizon 6s on t-mobile and everything works as well. is this a new thing? i've been working fine for months
the bizarre true story behind the “this is a work of fiction” disclaimer. it involves : via
because reality is stranger than fiction, we need to be reminded "this ain't real".
if you had any idea the kinds of emails i got from future trumpkins by opposing birtherism in '11 and '12-and donors i lost for
the question remains why the republican elites did not shut trump down when they could have.
that's a horror film lol
😂😂your on your game today must be sober 😳😳
this is not what it should look like! the author has said again and again that his version of the iron throne does not look like this
his envision matches this image: towering, menacing, uncomfortable ugly.. a metaphor for how "painful" it is to rule
yup i remember reading up on him. companies was really hot because he was accumulating more than companies put together.
not only that ppl wanted his shit more than the real louis. it's because he made things that urban ppl could wear.
it’s silicon valley def of design thinking that i find so problematic. i agree architects don’t think like lawyers.
yes, but never seen good discussion of that. and then there's this: says disappointed by result.

looking forward to rolling this out!
i wonder if there will be any nepotism in the trump white house?
barron's in charge of "no child left behind - in a gated community"!
happy birthday birthday pretty girl 😍🎂🎉
thankyou beautiful ❤️
she doesn't have many of those, unless fundraisers are "clinton events" and donors are "surrogate speakers."
hillary doesn't need surrogate speakers to hold her hand &amp; praise her endlessly lime cheetonazi does
i'm imaging w/deploystudio right now, while great for the initial setup, i want users to be more self-sufficient via a casper portal
oh cool. i’ve been using the built in tools in os x server for imaging our macs but we only have 26 so it works well.
folks: do we want another prez who lies about our security? no! knowledge=power. empower yourselves!
so why vote trump? change the motto to "trump lies and flip flops on everything, but we don't care"
the most important word in washington today: lie
actually, it's two words: big lie. see: goebbels, joseph

we are sealed by the holy ghost, even if you backside and fall in sin, once you're truly saved there is no condemnation
i mean he just has a history of letting shitty shitty people get free press on his show w/o askin any actual questions
and trump is the worst offense
. . then what the hell was clinton apologizing for? seriously take your head out of sand
well said! the world is blowing up around us &amp; she focuses on this. seriously?!??
our album is gonna be 🔥🔥🔥🔥
release date coming soon
i would be thrilled if would put out a new record. (also a collab with me would be dope) 😉
dude seriously feel this
friday night is proud to welcome free in the grandview lounge
bless!. . .
same number who this ?
tell me if its a true upgrade or just same ol' shit with a new outfit.
away on biz ive done all reset plus powered off/on. concern led is steady red. wifi distance is no issue.
it must be reset. see here: or call us at 516-520-5258
yes, but never seen good discussion of that. and then there's this: says disappointed by result.
i'm agreeing with you, . and think there might be an article in architect's design thinking &amp; urban design versus planning.
so hungry for the new zeason of tonight.😛🍧
uh oh...that ain't good
wow. cnn: the pool tv producer was physically restrained from going on trump's hotel tour, to prevent any questions.
why? what was said on tour? speak to anyone there??
really good (not pr/marketing-ish) interview by . would love 2 c sam interviewed! mayb?
i'd love to. would love to interview elon, too.
ok i'll do that. well, my chores are calling. yelling-lol catch up in a bit!!
me too. got to go to gym yuck and shopping yeah and then work all weekend. have fun talk later.
i thought the ex aridi testified she picked him up to go to legacy on saturday 8/30...?
she could have driven his car. sasso said that.lp
if trump wins it gives weight to idea you can say anything in primary and "pivot" for general election. apparently people have no memory.
the multitude of position reversals is astounding. even more so that people continue to believe him.
about time you on this shit 👏🏻👏🏻
nigga still don't gotta tweet 😂😂😂😂
true, &amp; hopefully i can get things to turn around. it never should have gotten to this point!
good luck with everything 💪🏻
you a place to rest your beer and someone to confess to?
among other things
trump finally says president obama was born in the us
that's not the damn headline and you know it! shame on you! blames hillary, never apologies for years of disrespect!
donald trump constantly disrespects the media but like an abused victim, the media still love their abuser.
damn straight, and they keep coming back for more abuse.

i haven't seen the msft mobile comeback into grey in any public narratives among the technorati , just consumers recently
talking about driving a &gt;&gt;trump's ridiculous claim that hillary clinton started the birther movement
more lies 2 feed his supporters bcause without those lies &amp; innuendos he wouldn't b where he is today as a conman
as trump highlighted economy, opponents focused on other topics, attempt to push media conversation away...
obvious now hlry's whole campaign isbased on negatives and divisiveness. pity if it works as will prove her constuency deplorable
do we know how often he generally went through half a tank?
just filled up, then half tank.
go ahead. i sent one at halftime that said you'd win bc god ain't giving me a nd and fsu loss in consecutive nights.
i specifically remember that one. but i tweet here and there on y'all shit. not all game. only will this week cause of the talk.
i'm agreeing with you, . and think there might be an article in architect's design thinking &amp; urban design versus planning.

tv ratings: 'thursday night football' premiere drops from 2015
never again
bamm! just pulled the "birther" rug from underneath hillary's cankled legs
nobody with an iq above 40 believes this. trump ran a racist charade for years.
as the idiots used to say at the very good steakhouse i once worked in: "gimme both." meaning a1 and 57. on filets.

ha ha. that was some shitty lineup
53 days to go and climbing in the polls donald j trump does the biggest flip-flop in political history announcing that obama was born in us!
it's pathetic that any sane person is taking trump seriously, he's dangerous 2 america's national security.
did you sent them an appropriate response like 🖕?

only game on bro... stretch before you reach

i'd actually rather the car was empty, since it cuts down the risk of dooring or the driver's moving.
tbh i prefer someone be in it w/ windows down so i can share thoughts.
with what invitation? tuh
so long as i can get into the building, i know the code to your apartment. don't ever play yourself, scallywag.
like he didnt spend 8+ years vilifying a duly elected president. like the whole movement was motivated by racism and xenophobia.
like trump didnt try to pull the same shit with ted cruz. like trump didnt hire ppl who believe the same shit.
has anyone ever put sparkling water in a keurig? would it make sparkling coffee? did i just invent something here?

"donald trump is unfit to be president of the united states." -
hahahaha this from someone who was dragged, unconscious, into a limo and disappeared to her daughters!
ok this whole tmobile and ios 10 thing is it only affecting peasants ?
seems like it cause i haven't had any issues
2) trump takes credit for “finishing” the birther controversy. he didn't.
3) this "presidential campaign event" with press in attendance was actually hotel launch promo
and like i said, you're skirting around the word. lies are pretty evident, especially with one candidate.
ready to say "lie" yet? or is it still too harsh?
this whole week has been rough not just last night.
what's wrong
how come all the boys tht fall in love w me can't spell the word definitely :// i'm not tht mad jus wondering tho lol
mandela effect. it was definately. swear on my life.
. tv critic scolds jimmy fallon: was it 'moral' to 'just have fun' with 'indecent' trump?
indecent? you deceive your readers every day and call someone else indecent? check out the splinter in your own eye.
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .
that pretty much nails it.
it's time to double down and support hillary. i'm serious.
oh god. now you've really lost it
it took me a min to realize that was my closet lol
yes your stylish walk in closet lol
i could see this song growing on me - i have a soft spot for any song where she throws out ascending wooops for ad-libs

bw support clinton for numerous reasons (obviously clinton family has strong connections to older black america)
oh, totally. and it was young poc who backed bernie, but of course none of these people live within a factual world
well, unfortunately i woke up
*fortunately
i gave up and left 😞 i was counting on reservation time being accurate. i'll go back later. good luck!
ugh yeah. i’m gonna have to do that soon if this line doesn’t move… 😭
obama was born on mars.
this i buy judging by the iran deal alone.
one of the candidates is on the defensive about birtherism at least.
it's hillary. i promise you it was her and her top strategist, mark penn
all these update and we still cant edit tweets.
bruh this tweet deserves endless rt's
we're now going to talk about hillary's role in birtherism, which is a total win for trump.
: we still remember when vindictive hilarity brought up lbama's foreign birth in kenya, as kenyans admit, including obama &amp; family.
we are alarmed to hear this, wink. please feel free to dm us with more information regarding this. ^eb
i just posted to you i will not be quit for my harassment
our lock screens match
ayye!! that's lit!🔥
was it a fun time on laverne and shirley? hopefully they were still getting along at that point
loved working on !! was amazing!
hey bro, just dropping a line to say that i loved your breakdown of art of war album. keep doing your thing man!
thank you ali!
why dont you cover segas boxing games?
buster douglas can go piss up a rope
lol was it at least for laughs? did ppl see it coming? would trump's team deliberately choose fallon for that reason?
yes and yes and yes and that's why it's scummy. fallon cares more about being liked by everyone than having a moral compass
i'm just gonna leave this here and then i'm done with last night's game, but could someone tell me why we pulled tanaka? 91 pitches in the
no strikeouts he had to battle. no one thought what happened in the 9th was gonna happen.
she's so fucking annoying
i hate her so much
i don't know who they are but you're right about "aggravating" 😬
i found out ... one is a prior nannie &amp; the other is a magazine editor. i'm still annoyed.
i just posted to you i will not be quit for my harassment
from i mean
note to , repeat after me: "do not let him get in your head" do not let him get in your head" "do not let him..." run your own race
&amp; should be the message the media must put out daily so the american folks can see trump as the professional conman he truly is!!
keanaaaaaaa! this world is way too small. joe has been hanging out with your uncle (shaylen's dad) lately lol.
hahaha i know shay told me she's seen him around the house a few times ! that's crazy
this is what barcelona looks like from a helicopter.

especially because it still renders like a regular gun on other platforms. it's more confusing now.
wait that actually is a good lineup
we are getting a group and going lol
yes and yes and yes and that's why it's scummy. fallon cares more about being liked by everyone than having a moral compass
even if it means petting a fascists hair on national tv
really? what "systems"?
sounds like a cheap excuse
hillary clinton linking her collapse to how women have to work harder in the office these days
throwing every excuse against wall hoping one will stick
trump's entire premise for saying "i finished it" re birtherism is that it's valid line of inquiry. it is not! racism is exhausting.
. we women think everyday before deciding where/how we go to be safe. blacks must do so 100x more. racism is exhausting!
get an old fashioned alarm clock!
i have two :(
shut uppp😭 just when i thought i was over snowglobe.........
dude it is so fucking fire like we have to go...!!!
.1) $10mm to the charity of your choice if you let me interview you for 4 hrs on your policies and their substance.
i bet you could get a couple hundred million contributed to make this happen. would turn down $200 mm? coward.
like trump didnt try to pull the same shit with ted cruz. like trump didnt hire ppl who believe the same shit.
like saying, "oh, i lied", is enough to forgive the 8 years of racist bullshit.
donald trump is poison for all americans he is crazy dangerous lying
speaking to the choir.. total agreement. now, how to get to the young ones so they see the light??
*cynical asshole voice* but brad, there is no difference between news and entertainment now

as 35-year nyt reader, former columnist, lifelong nyer, it's been painful to watch paper this year. (not you personally).
no, he's a racist.
yeah, that, too! definitely that.
odd that our measures of animal intelligence are often tests of what humans do best rather than of what they do best.
we judge robots the same way!
colourpop had a lip shade called gypsy and people were rightfully upset so they're letting fans choose a new name for it 😭
i know nobody should get a pat on the back for just being decent &amp; not racist but i've never seen a major corporation do something like that
after spending a lovely night in cambridge and taking the amtrak through new haven all i can think is "and rory chose yale?"
hartford isn't anything great either...i remember being like "emily gilmore lives here?"
with chris ivory officially ruled out, tj yeldon, in his spectacular mediocrity, is near must-start material. huge workload. san diego.

these lemon lovelies are lovely!
media acting like spoiled children on trump announcement about obama. this is not an issue, the economy and national security are
takes eyes off his economic plans!
i wish juicy couture tracksuits were still a thing *sigh*

: the true hillary clinton.
yes thank you for asking☺️ been so busy with family it's been crazy but fun crazy! you're the greatest take care🇺🇸vote trump 🇺🇸🚂🐘
ohhhhh good ...happy to hear that !! !!
thought about some sparklines: lack of common scale makes them meaningless. is it just me?
disagree. more interested in trends for each state than how states compare to each other.
“when i’m under the weather, i can afford to take a few days off," clinton said. "millions of americans can’t."
karma is a bitch hillary when it bites you; all that laundered money and no health !
hey —see correct wapo headline, unlike yr versions that fail on trump's prolific lying abt pbo.
add to list of outlets that reflexively expunged from trump's record his true mendacity over the birther embrace. please fix!
...is this a photoshop?
nah, david brooks talked about football and thanksgiving fucking, in the new york times
sounds like a cheap excuse
no idea. but they told people they could leave and come back any time this weekend. so i moved way up in line! 🤘🏻
but some european countries are very different from the us. you barely get wifi in berlin...

to be clear, i was responding to the offer to let him keep it all. clearly he'd turn down the charity idea.

happy friday! told you i'd be putting another one out today. made this during some dark times, hope you enjoy 🍧🍧🍧

delete this shit
nah cause that's facts
as long as the pizza tastes good does it matter?
what happens to the millions of fast food workers, taxi drivers, mall workers, etc. we are talking massive unemployment.
it's now forever settled: is a lying racist piece of garbage.
be careful, that kind of rhetoric will only enhance image among his followers.
smh majority young poc hate the clintons. older poc are more conservative, the kind of ppl who supported war on drugs
yeah, of course. i just love when people weaponize identity politics like this
awesome. you'll have one before me. so will my wife. the world is upside down!
this phone is prettttty nice :) (so's the watch)
wow! of &amp; &amp; of legends! thank you for all you do!
thank you friend!
. secy. vilsack says he has no question has the strength of message &amp; character to win the election
hillary showed the courage of a player ,playing hurt, and still scoring a touchdown.
hi! it says at imdb that you and were classmates at usc. did you know each other well?
we were students at ~ ally was a year behind me and we knew each other.
this is key. press simply cannot report, 'this is what trump statement said' when it was all categorically false
if wins, racism wins and we can rightly expect his supporters rise to violence.
i know hahaha that's why this is so funny. she wasn't even slick about it at all 😂she had me screaming every time she did it.
i think he was trying to protect her and not say anything bad he was in game mode still protecting his girl

it does lol why don't you want creatine? it's essential for muscle growth
so i mentioned that today couldn't be worse off-the-field for than ystrdy. can i recant? ...
what is a show-cause?
because not only did they probably not say it right, you probably didn't hear it right
you always set the example
i wish i could understand god's plans
you're amazing inside and out. love you beautiful 😘💕
honestly so stoked it's friday, work killed me this week
then this isn’t the real marissa. get out of here imposter.
to close guantanamo, obama is now releasing terrorists that *his own task force* said should never be freed.
explain how your esteemed congress allows him to do this👎👎🇺🇸
got kicked out of the club lmfao ayee we turnt
lmao where?!
orgs who say you've got that open space without the other components won't be sustainable. that's my kvetch.
"empowerment" bothers me these days. you don't "grant" power, people have power, or not. best orgs accept lost control
i don't give a flying you know what where the traitor was born. he isn't an american and he'll never be!
right on the money sister, right on. trump!!!
just find a player and go to their game log tab
oh cool, thanks

🔥🚨hillary birther🚨🔥 america's memory is so bad, they forget the 2007-08 clinton camp actually started
no it did not start with them.
but this is all irrelevant. the fact is trump didn't allow the official pool to go with him, successfully avoiding answering any questions.
is this what you or anyone would want in wh ? must be shamed and told outright he is a liar and manipulator
i don't care what none of y'all say, i'm fresh.
that was the best tweet ever, wish i saw it earlier

they're shooting for quantico three blocks away from me 😩😩
stay there woman
thanks for the rt, how's th big apple today?
clear &amp; beautiful. nice to take a walk around the city or if not. i'll usually head out to the beach &amp; feel the ocean breeze.
here's how trump treated veterans before he ran for president:
because there was no profit in veteran's issues back then. there sure is now.
hell freezes over, cows fly! the actually likes the economic plan.
because most of it is centered on growth, not government subsidies!
he's the nominee because he's a birther. his campaign is a sham. he's surrounded by white nationalists.
all a con game &amp; it's time most of us call it just that.
when u get a job at h&amp;m to stop being broke but you'll prob still be…

they take out a pro pack and add coins. you should still get 2 pro packs along with all that for 10 wins
you get 18k and the jersys quicksell for 7.5 thats fine
lmao he literally pet his hair? he must have morals tho. has he explained himself? what exactly was the interview about?
yes and no he hasn't.and just watch it. it's about as substantive as an interview with an actor of a new movie
thanks! gotta give a shout out to studio mate who did the heavy lifting.

fact checker: recidivism watch: trump repeats debunked claim that clinton ‘started the birther controversy’
again! in psychology, it is called "projection or transferral". narcissists never take responsibility of their own crimes.
hr deputy: the department is 80% redundant. we are interchangeable, so i suggest a ro-sham-bo tournament.
coo: good point, stan. but we call it rock-paper-scissors here. don't forget it. for your frankness, you are hereby promoted to head of hr.
isnt that everyday?
that is the impression i was under.
long overdue, but good to see the senate approve much-needed aid for flint. time for the house to do the same. -h
still nothing to say about
oh, great then! so, what makes you think that this wasn't what bishop oyedepo meant? tell me...
the bible teaches once saved always saved, pastor oyedepo got it wrong sorry to say
holy shit psyduck has no chill right now
jfc psyduck slow down i'm worried about you
now that would be funny.
now that's the the kind of development worth pursuing!
if trump isn't a birther, does he regret leading the movement for four years? does he apologize to obama?
only took him four years to decide. very decisive.
not .015. it's 0.15 -- still ridiculously low, as you said.
what about the testosterone level? he's 70 and weighs a ton! total bullshit.
if you have any dilithium lying around, you just bought yourself a ticket on board!
have you given any thought to bringing teslas ideas out of the closet....

let gary johnson debate. jesus fucking christ
i wish, but don't see it happening in a fixed system

the number of trump signs along highway 99 in the central valley is both shocking and appalling.
imagining what any of these farm towns would be like if trump gets elected. the local economy would collapse in two minutes.
exactly that why we need somebody to be on game like he was back in the 80's.
well i'm here for the game bruh.
trump’s lies cannot go unchallenged: 1) trump has been an unrepentant birther 2) hrc has never entertained this racist conspiracy theory
not so. she did, per 2007 top strategist, mark penn!
happy friday! have a great weekend too 🌼🙂
thank you margie❤️
asked if she is a birther: "no. if trump says obama was born in america he was. whatever trump says is true."
saddest thing i've seen today. bless her heart.

they say any publicity is good publicity. after trump said he could shoot someone didn't his polls go up? media certainly did it
and because of pat little sayings just like this, the system needs direct actions, not words. it's all been said before.
agree. but you can't lose hope either

trump loses in court
believes tough negotiating means not paying workers
if trump isn't a birther, does he regret leading the movement for four years? does he apologize to obama?
and what exactly convinced him? when was that? we know it wasn't the birth certificate or anything else pre-2014 or 2015.

i think he is good i watch him every week he just isn't on same level he was. he was unreal at one time
watching (which i'll be on)discussing trump &amp; birtherism, his speech, etc. it's as if hillary is a bystander in this campaign.
she is a bystander. its her media that's running vs trump

oh hello i love you
do you want bears?! cuz that’s how you get bears!
i haven't /quite/ reached peak grumpiness and oldness yet
peak? there is no peak.
that is the only reason we watched. if it was on sat we would've watched our game or bama or oklahoma or uga..
lol cmommmm our game was the most anticipated game of the week.
she doesn't have many of those, unless fundraisers are "clinton events" and donors are "surrogate speakers."
i can't recall🚑
seems like most disappointing moment personally for trump of campaign was when he acknowledged our first black president was born in us. sad
but he threw focus back at her saying she started it. you cannot speak to an irrational person.
whys there people rapping out loud to beats on their phone on the tram 😫😖😫😖
the question is... why haven't you got their autographs yet?? 😊🖊

won't be long. just need food first.
why are disparaging people with low iqs? are you some kind of racist?
why do you say that i am disparaging them. and since i don't mention race, why are you bringing it up?
ugh i should really move to new york instead of spending all my money coming to visit every couple months
i said the same thing so here i am. lol
a governmental commitment to hold a public referendum, currently the campaign is to press for this asap

i'm pretty sure there was something in that drink.... or that's his natural state of flop
i dont understand what's going on. i can't wrap my mind around why media/news just let this shit slide
and plenty of the media doesn't. it almost like he spews so much bs that it dilutes it all into not being a big deal.
'okay, so the latest i have to leave to get to the airport on time is 9:50' -waits, idly, until exactly 9:50-

after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
since when did they stop chasing him?
it apparently came from fans of a gay av. pretty interesting stuff tbh
that’s amazing, one of the more convoluted evolutions of slang linguistics i’ve seen
- because me and her friends you not about to throw shade like i won't tell her lmao.
sis ... this nigga wearing jeans with a chain around 😭 i don't argue with the mediocre
he should also be put in ecl pending trial in extra judca
and put him in the same cell as waseem akhtar lol
only been at work nothing but 2 hours and these fools already tripping me out 🤔
that shit ain't new
we're going to sink that racist birther. you can count on it.

this issue was 1st presented by hillary in2008! so, she is making a huge mistake saying it's racist!!
show me where clinton challenged obama's birth certificate.
trump jr. insists "gas chamber" remark was "poor choice of words," not a holocaust reference
why, people talk about gas chambers in polite discussion all the time. what's the problem?
it was, there wasn't another option like there will be on saturday. niggas just want to watch football bruh it's simple
oh no doubt. so why y'all be tripping when we tweet y'all. it's football we wanna watch.
do you know what ignorant means? 🤔 denotation not connotation? 🤔 i feel like you don't
what you feel is of zero importance to me. you're synonymous with ignorant....... hope that helps.
thanks, , for helping white people to understand that "can i touch your hair?" can be a horrifying question.
that was shameful, man, treating trump like some harmless outrageous cartoon rather than a dangerous bigot.
today we can eat mooncakes and view the moon with family!🌕🐇🎑 🎑

happy birthday, bro! have a great one 😎
thanks, matt! miss you guys up there.
i have health problems caused by i want to know it isn't happening to the next guy in line.
understood. medical errors are a high cause of death for everyone. it killed my grandfather. a lot needs to change.
oh good, they got my request!
they're playing call me maybe now!!!
hillary clinton and donald j. trump trade barbs over obama 'birther' flap
trump could not have stated it more concisely and to the point means not a barb🇺🇸🇺🇸

thanks gidi! consider supporting our new pilot! ❤️
guys! today marks the day i came out to my parents, 10 years ago!!! 🌈🌈🌈 after getting caught with my then gf... also happy birthday mom!!!
a celebratory day! this is my 10 year too! mines was in april. 🌈 mazel tov!
also, obama himself said he was born in kenya and raised in indonesia in harvard law review 1991. lie??
if you are so stupid to believe that, i am blocking you.
i gave up. ill deal with everything tomorrow after work 😭
my ghetto ass with all those damn trash bags 😭
do you normally pet a dog, or pat a dog? how do you draw the distinction?
for me petting combines the patting and stroking dog modalities
you still here?
sorry man, i missed your tweet and wasn’t able to find ya! hope you had luck getting yours!
going back in a few minutes to get my phone.
damn i wish i had seen this earlier! what’d you get?
after you're done restoring your iphone you get... this ui? that's it?
dat clarity
media—do not be gulled by trump’s claim to ‘believe’ pbo was born here—after conducting a 5-yr birther crusade.
after trump's stunt, i believe ppl will be so scared of him being prez, that the 3rd party vote drift may begin drying up. media shift, too.
the number of trump signs along highway 99 in the central valley is both shocking and appalling.
in other news, bakersfield has a maserati dealership.
trump jr. insists "gas chamber" remark was "poor choice of words," not a holocaust reference
just like his father was not mocking the reporter's disability
trump and clinton’s exchanges on health have been tame compared with past elections
hillary just couple days back was in bad shape, came back like a bull
he appreciates me for the princess i am
yea duh ofc you're a princess
q: how are we evaluating the settlements? a: it depends on the theory of dmgs: 1. risk of future harm and 2. loss of benefit of the bargain.
we like the second theory better because it leads to better settlements.

wait does metro carry iphones? the other 2 r for the kids.
donald trump claims hillary clinton started the birther controversy:
irrelevant. she dropped it. trump ran with it for no apparent reason.
i was referring to his expecting the press to act like thinking entities rather than entertainment reporters
who is "the press?"there's plenty of smart coverage.but for the traditional press, calling out lies is now media bias.
trump is about two days from attacking hillary clinton's failed casinos and raising questions about her sealed divorce from ivana.
spot on, it's the whatever i do sticks to you, mentality. and the media's force feed continually legitimizes dt's insanity.

say what you will about king solomon, he knew a thing or two about american politics
consider this a subtweet
lost in shuffle this am - trump attacked cosmo and reporter who interviewed ivanka/asked her about trump statements
trump's insistence on pursing every perceived slight would be disastrous in a world leader.
part of me wants a bath robe, but another part of me knows i would spend too much time in it. it would be a gateway drug to hard laziness.
i don't get those robes. wouldn't being wrapped in such a blanket, all wet, be.... uncomfortable?
damn. i mean, on one hand, that's not the role of talk shows. but otoh, he is kind of a fascist lol every opportunity to point
yeah i mean the show doesn't have to take hardline political stances but it also shouldn't act as a pr machine for literally
been covering the clinton campaign since the outset. this has never happened to us.
when is the press going to stop pussyfooting around this guy?
he should be tried in the icc in hague for over 100 fake police encounters and extra judicial killings
maybe he should join psp or police-pakistan :p
wow can't believe they stole my startup idea
new quest flavor? 🤔
my mom just referred to the city of kingston as "kinky kingston" for no discernible reason and i'm so confused
which kingston? ny?
i know it is soup. i'll try it if i see it in restaurants. as long as it doesn't have cream, i will probably like it
zero cream. tomato base. raw veggies. any decent mexican or spanish restaurant will have it. upscale amer. might
i don't feel sorry for the press because the press doesn't hold trump accountable.
no, i don't feel sorry 4 them, what i mean is he's treating press like theyve no right to cover him campaigner manhandled 1 of em
this is bs hyperbole, trump's conned media to greater effect for 30 years.
read a book on trump published before he ran for president, your ignorance is showing.
has this ever been screened in nyc before?
it has and i miss it every damn time!
not a claim but supporters started claim against '08 dem primary. watch 60mins hrc also
doesn't matter after he kept it going for 3 years
this is normal
and the 6s plus
this is essentially like talking to a brick wall. i'm done here.
matt it's exhausting
don't you have boards to study for 🤔
why you clocking me
spending $31 each week on a metro card pisses me off.
girl you better off with an unlimited
i can be silly but i'm not. research in lit might help. why do quotes stick with us from books written before we were born?
there is also research that shows large majority of published research in english lit is never referenced again.

"all these polls are a joke. a joke," says harry reid. points at and says companies like his employer (cnn) pay for "cheap polls."
yes they are a joke! if they were fair they would show with a 15 point lead.
new home button feels terrible.
you feel terrible.
yeah i mean the show doesn't have to take hardline political stances but it also shouldn't act as a pr machine for literally
anyone of a certain profile that asks to be on the show. letterman would have grilled trump
i love the idea that the first hour' s spent not on a current project!
yes! not always easy to do, but schedule it on your calendar like anything else. make it habit.

sony acts disgusted yet they're now denying people nms refunds over psn. gimme a break.
it didn't literally happen but it's pointing out that fallon didn't challenge trump on his racism, just laughed with him.
explain to me trump's racism. what about trump is racist?
sorry man, i missed your tweet and wasn’t able to find ya! hope you had luck getting yours!
still in line. they said the system went down but its back up now.
leave to the nascar guy. it's chick fil and it's not even that close.
blasphemy. y'all have a dang race named after bojangles.
but tell us how you really feel
i'm cranky and need a nap 🙃
i raised my voice bc you said you couldn't hear me 🙂🙂🙂
mhm whatever
where is this
hunter college
bummer that only 2/8 i've checked from my podfile so far have rendered change logs 😞
welllllll there is this from :
i wrote a long piece about some of the problems with startup equity:
good complement to my piece today: "the truth about next year's ipo 'rush'"
i like bernie, i wanted to see him and hear his speech
i figured that. i was making a joke because i don't care for politics
it's obvious you used low iq as an insult. it's a fact that the average aa iq is lower than those of whites. racist!
there is so much faulty logic here that i don't where to begin. so i won't.
you just contradicted yourself
i was being sarcastic all i'm saying is i just don't like it when artist make it seem like they're down to earth of that's not
trump is still refusing to say whether he believes president obama was born in hawaii. “i’ll answer that question...
trump-the-schlocksucker finally admits obama born in the u s of a. how cocky!
i'll think she'll arrive w/ plenty of facts/proof
but this isn't a normal debater. look at the primary debates. anything but the topic at hand.
out of town dude
i know but i just wanted to see the movie :-/ i hope you enjoyed
overdo birthday thingie for the great !
ohmygoddd ahhhhh ♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️❤️ thank you for this!!
remind us next week before the game!
. follow and "turn on notifications for tweets with live video"
i don't. just find it strange that members in your fandom seem to always make it about us. i rarely tweet you dweebs
loooooool your our rival and we on a six game winning streak. the tweets gon go. you gotta expect that.
once again, the american news media gets totally played by trump. wall-to-wall coverage. we’re all guilty.
we're not all to blame. people in charge make decisions about what is "news" based on training, ethics etc; it'sjust a $ grab
also i know ny has some weird laws about putting stickers on things (fiancé went to jail for putting a sticker on a post)
whoa, that's a heavy price to pay for a sticker.
i wish these perf benchmarks had knockout, for a fuller picture of where we are. that data exist? /
or backbone
if restaurant that does not compete on volume (e.g. not mcdonald's) has low-$ kid's menu, does that suggest their adult food margins high?
of course it's too much to ask for yelp reviewers to make sense, but i saw one complain that a tiny cheap-ish diner doesn't have kids' menu
well, it's my dune fan's golden birthday today! could you please give a shout out to esau? thanks!
🗣happy birthday esau!🎂
we like the second theory better because it leads to better settlements.
our theory in the new adult toy case is that ppl would not have bought the product if they knew abt its practices.
im at the hard rock cafe in philadelphia
did u get a shirt or shot glass
i was being sarcastic all i'm saying is i just don't like it when artist make it seem like they're down to earth of that's not
the case of its just about the money let it be known especially if people feeling you
i can be silly but i'm not. research in lit might help. why do quotes stick with us from books written before we were born?
can't win me over to position of "it's all good and beyond reproach and we need more please"
just watched that video and i'm in tears. this issue will forever break my heart.
me too, i am so sorry
is this a rhetorical question?
bring it if you have an answer
you must do some home work before you tweet next time. go find out what the 3 ministers did in brazil.
well have you done the homework? cm on medical leave, delhi is almost in icu and deputy cm goes out ..

i'm not sure i have a working install of itunes anywhere.
started learning japanese this morning ... i wonder if it will be harder or easier since i barely know english.
hard as fu*k more letters in its alphabet and harder to pronounce
nothing trump can say will ever erase the fact that for 5 years he tried to delegitimize america's 1st black president w/racist .
we have free speech and freedom of information. the racism card is going the way of boy called wolf.
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.
hahahaha great speech today tricking the media into following all your military endorsments
i think my beyoncé concert was better than drake this summer but honestly they both gave me life

i was physically dead at drakes concert right until i heard his voice and i rose from the dead
i dead napped for like 45 minutes at the concert 😭
when donald trump jr. isn't retweeting racists, he's busy lying. it's a genetic family trait
every newspaper &amp; legitimate network should be demanding what is trump hiding? his tax returns are essential to the public's right to know.
of course it's too much to ask for yelp reviewers to make sense, but i saw one complain that a tiny cheap-ish diner doesn't have kids' menu

my test is always walking through an ice. the new ms stuff is still minimal against ipads and *bulky* plastic laptops
i think the surface is too expensive still for most; but this will change within a year
it took years for the almighty trump to 'legitimize' our president and he does it now for publicity and black votes
he's deluded if he thinks today's antics got him anyone's votes
set my alarm to wake up early and do stuff. wind up falling asleep every time i try to get up. it's work season, all right. :/

but i'm on my way to school right now because i'm such a perfect student and my class is like 70% participation.
but will trump release long-form, written proof that he was wrong about the president's birthplace? 🤔
u &amp; the rest of the media should report this daily until election. would be justice if this is the lie that takes trump down!
very cool. travel safe!
thank you! my grandma is super excited .

trump blames birther controversy on clinton
this man is truly pathetic
the most striking number here may be that 99% of americans 18-29 do use the internet. it is now universal.
that is amazing. there are towns where kids congregate outside the police station for the wifi. (read: uses != has regular access to)
in the past week my iphone 6s+ battery has been draining like... anyone else?
yes totally useless after an hour or two and unexpectedly shutting down while the indicator days 20-40% left
yeah. sorry this is happening. again 🎥
enjoy directing ❤️😀👍
but i'm on my way to school right now because i'm such a perfect student and my class is like 70% participation.
i will be posting a unboxing today as soon as i get home or my iphone comes.
moving on to now.

the question is the bank shot--can hillary use birtherism, an attack on obama, as a means of generating enthusiasm for her candidacy?
if obma truly at 50% approval rating its probably a wash. still, she's concerned about her base
hopefully i'll be back in like a month or so it's kinda boring here since i can't talk to anyone i'll hit you up when i'm back tho!
damn that's true gotta find a nice italian girl 😂 but i saw your fb post too, you all good with that?!

you scan an item, put it on the belt, and pay
hillary clinton is a moron. you don't win votes by attacking people. didn't the last 8 months prove that?
hrc is incapable of learning. no matter how often something doesn't work, she just keeps hitting the repeat button.
let's be clear the press is no victim, they enjoy every second all that 💰💰rolling in. zucker, moonves &amp; lack.
ur missing my point. in fascist countries they deny the press access. this is what i am talking about

i usually use soy but i'm open to trying anything lol i like mild sweetness
that verse kills me every time 😭
that entire song honestly 🤕
trump didn’t apologize. he didn’t even really acknowledge that he was wrong. then he hustled off that stage like the coward he is.
. - didn't watch it (wasn't worth my time) trump &amp; his campaign has proven 2 b a 4 ring circus. msm making big $$$!

at least he's aware of the end results and isn't like, "he's just so honest, he's the real voice of the people"
clinton campaign started it. clinton should not remind voters of her nasty 2008 campaign w/ obama
it was so nasty, vicious, mean, unfair that he appointed her secretary of state.
she actually looks pretty strong today. must be the steroids.

you ever just "know" when you're about to connect with someone on some deep level? and all you feel is excitement? yea... that times 10
i was that excited 2 see my 1st @ staplec 9-9-01. been to every, since. some deep connection, mostly pure bliss
questions for trump: why did trump go to wnd's joseph farah and say, "what can we do to turn the tide?" (source: 's nyt piece.)
and what specific evidence was he referring to when he said his investigators in hawaii found stuff people "wouldn't believe?"
sent this to spox, to ask how he will fulfill promise to give $5m if assured pres. obama born in us
fahrenhold's 1 of 20 wapo picked to create false trump narratives...will he have job aft election?
i don't speak head injury. subtweeting makes you appear passive aggressive. move on, know when you're unwanted.
funniest comment ever.
let me know how worth it standing in line was when your phone crashes lol
are you talking about the new iphone? lol.
jesus. trump is now taking reporters "on a tour" of his hotel. this is real life?
- omg just had 2 lol, not at all surprised. he's an entertainer, sale's person, buffoon, prankster, con artist, &amp;vicious racist!
"i believe the best social program is a job" ~ ronald reagan donald trump understands this ... hillary doesn't 🤔
but they think welfare is a job!!
the bills should probably give sammy a week off. he doesn't look the same. also, compare the wr depth the jets have to the bills. not close
i understand the logic if you want to spend the gilmore $$ on someone else, but who? fa classes stink cause teams lock up guys
i remember clinton saying obama was not eligible to run. a big part of her campaign
that didn't happen. you have been punked.
a dog without a paw gets a hand
oh my goodness! cuteness overload! i god bless this sweet, little adorableness! thanks
. show us where hillary wants to rescind the 2nd amendment. give a specific quote.
i always ask for the facts and get the response that some "alt-right" (white supremacist) website said it.
the media is rightly upset trump wanted to use them to advertise his new hotel today. everyone knows he's not divesting if he wins, right?
divesting? is that the same as "doubling down" in the trump family?
this is the current version i made years ago. inspired by jacque fresco's model
i'm going to work ...i'll check when i get back, and retweet any other examples you put up..
hey nfl, take notes.

i agree with you esk on the h2h rewards looking nice now, but eb is right when it comes to non spenders, especially solos
the game is trash for people that dont spend money, you have to play h2h and win to get coins or just play alot
cry me a river. you have a great sense of humor.
lol, kenn, i am so mad. many of my friends are jobless, those with a job are underpaid &amp; someone is talking birth place

your the bossman today .way to go 😀👍
the fuck kinda hashtag is that . the davinci code
leave me alone it's for my science class 😅
you can argue today was good for trump the hotelier but no one with any knowledge of politics can say this was good for his campaign
the problem is people deciding whether to vote for him have no knowledge of politics though &amp; enjoy him fucking w/ media
freddy needs to get a job then!
i don't think he likes that idea

reid fires back at trump for mocking the accident that partially blinded him:

isn't it scary that the mainstream media aren't picking this up???
what's scarier is that the main street media purposely won't pick this story up.

just kidding. there's an app for everything. (glitchr)
i would love that! ☺️❤️
i'm all packed up just wondering what i'm going to be guided to do next. just a vague idea is all i have of what will be.

sorry to keep you waiting. we will deliver as soon as we are in your area. ^mh
no problem! it's not delayed :)
all fair points to my hyperbole, it's just been increasingly hard not to see fact-checking trump as futile
i agree with that. i don't think you can counter him with facts. at least not in print. curious about debates
you mean the way campaign illegally solicited donors from overseas, multiple times?

"rejuvenated by the mother's milk of compacted carbon..."
would you expect anything less. 🍎📱
i would expect a more craft/local granola bar
of course you are
thank you for the response. i have my fingers crossed 🤘
and it is that will fix all what you just mentioned. you must be having a laugh.
for now, he has the inclination and msg to fix it. hillary has been there for 30 +yrs, no results as powel said
. "i want to see more money go to people"
more cash in people's pockets and less in government coffers! that's capitalism!
tried playing with today. don't think i'll be able to get into it. too slow/boring. fifa fans, why do you love it?

why on earth would anyone question obama's place of birth when michelle called kenya his home country?
: out of the horse's mouth, obama was born in kenya.
of which he was probably saving for breakfast. forgive me. it was delicious.
i have been thinking for a long time about what a sweet, cold burrito would look like. choco taco??viennetta??
i feel bad..i ordered a keurig for my dad's office and now it's becoming a fiasco cause we need a plumber to connect the water line.
its the thought that counts though :)

yes she did👎👎👎

"trump is right: clinton’s child-care plan doesn’t exist"
wow of all people to defend trump. wow
glad you were in class today
it was great to be there. see you at 3
nobody with an iq above 40 believes this. trump ran a racist charade for years.
: you are full of dung. just ask his family in kenya, listen to his own video recorded admittances.
why is watching some white folks dance the worst and most awkward feeling imaginable
because reasons.
drinkss and food!!
definitely check out cedars! their lounge has a fabulous selection of cocktails &amp; craft beer plus delicious food
both of those have been debunked. hrc is getting deeper into trouble with fbi, foundation, health, seemingly endless scandals.
debunked =you his believe lies, no one else does. .&amp; trump's foundation is in a lot more trouble.
never fear, devoted readers: will be back writing a column.
jeff was at ct long before i started reviewing there in 2008, and in fact got me intro'd there in the first place. you're in good hands!
the issue is hillary's campaign started it..
mr. dane... you can't fix stupid ignorance from one's that are the same as racist trump.
dear fellow deplorable... what am i missing? silly q. what is ctr? i'm only coming up with click through rate :)
ctr usually leave positive yelp reviews or counter a couple of bad interviews-sometimes w/fact in face of slander
when was he a good impressionist? certainly not on snl...
yeah he started on snl doing very good impressions but intentionally moved away from that to stand out more

i've been working hard today... still so much to do 😭 this has to be my most labor intensive project to date.
hope we can shoot!
reporters: if you don't start getting furiously angry when lies to your face and plays you for fools, it means u have no self-respect

what's the best way to send feedback about changes in beta? i don't like the longer method for getting notifications from an account
we needed a way to introduce more notifications options. so adding an extra step was necessary i think. what would you propose?

no that's actually bill and hillary dressed up as a black woman
you are on tilt. ....good luck hope your life turns around, trump won't help it, he only helps himself.
reporters here at hotel shouting questions as trump delivers one paragraph on birtherism
not a paragraph just two short sentences!!
evolution of twitter. (via ) $twtr
this is the best was a game changer last-night. $aapl was smart they could 💸💰$twtr
give me my 45 seconds back . smh
gawd kill me now
(2/2) the facts are clear: our nation’s economy is getting stronger.
you are so out of touch with the people
after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
he says this after 5 years of pushing this and you don't think there are relevant follow up questions?
why do the republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? no more apologies--take the offensive!
i think the reason to apologize for years of lies is pretty obvious
q1: give us a brief introduction about you. what do you do?
do i have to use your @ handle when replying? or just the hashtag?

dear fellow deplorable... what am i missing? silly q. what is ctr? i'm only coming up with click through rate :)
sometimes,ctr counters bad reviews w/positive fake ones created by their minions,to whom they pay $10/hr
sometimes the return to routines means we get back to eating at home more &amp; have time to exercise regularly.
lol! routines of twitter moms! what comes 1st? your kid crying or a twitter party?
i cant believe kim and sin bought add space foe the yaoicon program and took a photo not at their table, but mine

i'd be curious for katrina's interpretation. would you mind elaborating ?
katrina pierson about to elaborate....
if trump is that overweight wouldn't he be a diabetic?
i am sure that it is a matter of time. he's a ticking timebomb.
i just realized that there is a in chicago. if i wasn't already looking forward to my trip next week, i certainly am now!!!

check out my response to you on facebook.
no that's actually bill and hillary dressed up as a black woman
about the same time trump paid a settlements for discriminating against blacks.
well yeah, there's the whole "normalizing a racist, misogynist sociopath who would start a nuclear war" thing. that's bad
yep. but sadly, that's just par for the media course these last 18 months.
what trump just did is a disgrace.
swing and a miss there -h. you and the squad out of ideas? try listing accomplishments, never mind.
wait what time

but that was because you wanted a head start lol, you can't buy yourself to 99 you gotta grind
did stock pickers get overfocused on macroeconomics and the fed etc, and therefore too risk averse in the period?
good thesis...
(4/4) i firmly believe that investing in job creation and ensuring equal pay for equal work will only add to the improving economic outlook.
dianne your data is scurf to make mother gov look good
it's hilarious how in their heads he is. every time they ask for apology gets a million more votes

i can't tell you how my heart swells at all this fantastic press for and . actually, i can...
big things are coming.
. admits that was started by herself and her nig nog minions
lol. that clip completely contradicts your claim. wow....
new: trump's event started hour late. why? for part, he was huddled with bannon, bossie, eric, etc asking advice on obama birth remarks.
donald was asking eric for advice?
i do not think that it can be generalized. low-$ but also small portions.
kids portions in places i've visited recently are ~2/3 of adult, but cheap foods (pasta, grilled cheese, fries)
dear fellow deplorable... what am i missing? silly q. what is ctr? i'm only coming up with click through rate :)
so, usually, the $10/hr. minions hold several accounts,different avi's, etc. and in this case,post positives abt hillary
love this!! where my bf at tho?? i look like a fifth wheel!!
5th wheel is the stabilizer of the foundation duh!
do they actually taste like cheetos? 🤔
they're alot like the original ones. it lacks the cheeto taste as it's fried away.
thank you! is there a certain dish that defines the brunch experience for you?
- your caviar station, simply unparalleled, as i discussed in my article: -
why do they even need to be frozen?
you freeze so they last for months, grab one n throw it in your kids brown bag every day and it thaws by lunch
the fix: today a new low for journalism but for trump, he was the ringmaster at the circus. "it was peak trump."
. trump's birther circus.
found the water tower!
and how many were there?
no, jimmy fallon, donald trump isn't a laughing matter | steven thrasher
bs-what about hillary clintons ? i am surprised at you-the democrats have taken advantage of the blacks 4 years

as i predicted this morning on : a brief reference, sweeping it away, on w business that matters.
very true-i heard it. hope fbn or fox gives good role on election night. your takes r refreshing😃😃
maybe the reason truth is becoming irrelevant in politics is because the truth is that politicians are losing their power.
. these are the two best ways to steal an election: either you control the identity registry (sybil attack) or generate gossip.

the world series shows the anthem. the olympics. stanley cup. nba championship and so forth. i'm not just talking about the nfl
yeah, the nationally televised big events, now they are showing during every game. coincidence??? nope.
2 is a major problem. but i think pcon is a good person who is just misguided sometimes. 3 is a fact.
3 is an honest, sincere appeal to see who you're surrounded by and reconsider standing with them.
kids portions in places i've visited recently are ~2/3 of adult, but cheap foods (pasta, grilled cheese, fries)
ppl then think "why can't they have kid menu, my kid doesn't eat much" forgetting overhead/labor considerations

q2: let's get into it. tell us in a nutshell what your concept of circle is about.
principle 1) ignorance - we begin by saying “i don’t know.” my customer my channel. my value prop.
why act as if getting high sends you to a trippy dimension where you can find yourself? bitch getting high is just chilling nothing more.
unless you eat an edible. those fuck you uo

principle 2) perspective comes from outside the building. from our customers and users.
creepy thin man from charlie's angels or big???? hope you're feelin 22 ily 🤘🏽💚
lmao thank you little. ily✌🏼️
do what you want. be real and honest about your shit. as long as you're honest, a person gotta respect you.

guise i love you but i'm not talking about a 1 star review by ppl who didn't like your book for no reason. i'm talking about literal nazis.
yes it stings when someone 1 stars &amp; galleys aren't even out. it's not the same as a crowd trying to tank your career based on your race.
q2: let's get into it. tell us in a nutshell what your concept of circle is about.
principle 3) build-measure-learn means 3.1) go faster 3.2) go backwards to go forwards.

sorry to misrepresent your response. there need to be a rider on poe's law.
the story isn’t that “trump now admits obama was born in america.” the story is “trump now admits he was lying for years.”
"all these years"? toure everything he says is a lie forever.
this is what would look like. we can stop it.
trully you are crazy.
did hillary really just say that trump doesn't consider blacks to be americans? my god.
her desperation is showing.
lol yea. i can't sleep in that class cause i sit in the front which is why he called on me.
why ar you at the front? hahahah

- that's all he's abt attention getting, showboating, bufoonery, exaggerating &amp; unadulterated lies!!
q4: how will you advice startups to use business model canvas?
the bmc is a tool to identify your assumptions. nothing more. don’t think of it like a fixed plan to follow.

boy you're buggin, did you listen to 300 bars?
birtherism will play loudly and often to minority voters, also trump stupidly put obama on the ballot. a vote vs dt preserves first aa pres
who cares about the birtherism-theonly ones who care are dems-because clinton is failing in the polls
holy fuck you made this?

not even necessary. you delay this long, your cronies will readily assume that your hand was forced. *wink*
oh, i agree. but he'll still double down again. it's maybe the one thing he actually believes.
trump supporters likely regard that as a positive.
all he did was full the media to talk about something else than his taxes, econ plan and son comments about gas chamber.
q2 why is starting off the day with a nutritious breakfast important? ad
a2 the start of the day- keeps your engine going ad
breaking exclusive: 'hillary clinton campaign systematically overcharging poorest donors' via... by
talk about this, fox news.
q5: just a bit into what you have thought in the past. what do you term "minimum viable experience"? a new buzz?
all these buzzwords are not helpful. “minimum viable happiness” is as good as any other term. just go create value.

nope 😎 but i'ma play it now and see.🎶🎤 the game don't impress me.
lol listen and then tell me what you think. top 5 diss track all time imo.
hmmm, i wonder what clintion had to say on when obama was actually running, when it mattered.
every day she was out on the campaign trail challenging obama's citizenship. it was deplorable.
djs - what's the worst confrontation you ever had with a requester?
i gave her a drink ticket to go away and she did not.
and your documented birtherism? hillary invented birtherism:
the great thing about these desperate tweets from hillary is we all just use them against her. they are such fools.

bush is bad nk? hillary and obama are worse
all she does is harp about bush. she has no valid argument.
clintons campaign definitely started the birther stuff its unfortunate how she has gotten away from the responsibility for that
"there is no record that clinton herself or anyone within her campaign ever advanced [birtherism]"

u mad he winning -- u gotta "accept this" lmao
big ups to my cousin hakeem green for this peace movementin the brick city lets keep the peace
looking for fathers to share expertise in this backiischool contest
to reiterate: nothing will change until tv cameras stop covering trump blindly and take a stand in solidarity...
nytimes also needs to double down against his constant lies and center the people he is harming (muslims, blacks)
almost got fucking lost on the subway
this old asian dude saved my ass

i can't understand them but from what the other fans are commenting.... what a mess
i dont really get why they are so defensive when he's obv talking about a few chinese sasaengs and not the whole chinese pop
i say this from experience before i started to meet more people from esc. i'll just leave it at that.
but we're talking about the three groups being out of sync, right? is that a negative interaction, or more just confusing

this character assasination from sugared water manufacturers will not stand!!
after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
i don't trust anyone who was pushing the birther issue to have the judgment to be president. do you?
could be in or ( if move)
speaking of an school should be in the 👌
yes. pretty insightful. the guys a dirtbag who has tried to dodge taxes and funneled money to his daughters charity.
now see? was it that hard?
and if you think trump started the birther you are truly ignorant
now crawl back into your hole with the other racist birthers...

answer the questions i sent and i'll update.
i had an operation the other day because having one scared me too much.
well, less of an operation and more of a procedure, but now i'm just being pedantic
- now you're following me? why do i have the feeling this relationship will be short, painful and end in tears?
i admire wit and artful syntax. we might make it if we don't take politics too seriously.
do they suck as much in the comics?
they're mixed, they're what i like to call bad '80s- exemplifying all the worst trends of that decade with none of the charm

could you please dm so we can get a little bit more information sans character limits? thanks!
the fact that it's news that trump admits is born in the us is ludicrous.
let us note that trump was completely wrong about his very first "political issue" (which was ludicrous to begin with).
i don't understand these people at all
to be honest, i am *somewhat* fascinated to know the psychological/emotional drivers here
say it ain't so, hannah! we're officially nearing the end of a girls era:
omg say it ain't so
why are u waiting in line at apple store?

proper button hole though?
that picture of the “loch ness monster” is clearly 3 seals playing…besides, it’s not even asking for “about tree fiddy.” nothing to see here
i am a lockness monster fan and supporter and i think its 3 seals as well. wish it wasn't.

they didn't say it, but it is implied if you are suggesting he's not a us citizen. and donald trump had a mother who was an
kanye loves 2 compare himself to walt &amp; steve but these men revolutionized how we consume all media resulting in new inventions &amp; inventors.
his music is barley good and he can make a proper shoe.
actually i take this back its just film
*film studies the name of the major explains all
xenophobic or prejudice or racist would be assuming that the person can't be president bc of background
constitution requires "natural born citizen". that's background. you over reach. and mistaken.
i am now going to the brand new trump international, hotel d.c. for a major statement.

oh is he apart of his campaign? jeez i didn't know that. you'd think it'd be news
nobody from clinton's 2008 campaign questioned obama's birth. nobody. there is no there there. another trump lie. add to the pile.

she was pretty cool on your show, but maaaan jimmy you've gotta check out. by any measure, waaay cooler than cl.
not sure the offense was the problem in buffalo. not great or anything, but lots of other issues too.
yeah. like the head coach
she started it - he helped finish it. obama is born in the us. let's move on to the real issues, like jobs, debt etc
i'm not ready to move on until the people of the united states and the gets a sincere apology. no more lies &amp; hate.
q8: if i'm a startup founder, how do i choose the right co-founders? who becomes ceo/cto/cfo/coo?

with no cards left to play doubles down on 2008 "birther" movement. sad.
well, she has no platform to stand on. what is she going to talk about.
i think the biggest thing that makes me sad is that for that amazing glossy look, you have to stick in a case for longevity :(
yeah. really that’s the problem no matter what…it’s why i don’t stress too much about color. haha.

2 is annoying and off-putting, but i don't understand how 1 is a big deal when understanding that ccl games are experimental

you realize how much you sound like "womanizers" when you continually talk her like this?
couldn't agree more. totally sexist, stupid comment. stay focused !
twitter implodes after birther-in-chief donald trump finally admits obama was born in u.s.
trump admitsobama usa-born butdoesn'tapologize.that word seems 2be missing from his emotional&amp;verbal lexicon.
getting an email that your domain is up for renewal is an excellent reminder to get started on that site.
or that it's time to call that list again
your pot/black hero!
thug *ss lecturing us. plz! love him up
what did trump do?? i'm out of the loop😣
but he said it in a 33-second statement with no explanation, no questions. and he blamed hillary for starting birther
this seems like a significant turning point.
oh wow...this was it? not his daily lying?
bills firing their offensive coordinator. because our 31 points to the jets' 37 was all his fault.
respectfully disagree. that ej/timeout sequence from last night was horrifying.
is it fire? imma listen soon
i only heard a muffled clip but he was gettin real disrespectful, said he wants to fuck nicki 😂😂😂
q9: how will you describe innovation? does it affect the way startups define value to customers?
innovation is creating not capturing value that no one else has done before. can be incremental or disruptive
i've noticed people don't talk about "hadoop ai" the way they talk about "spark ai". what would hadoop ai mean and what's its future if any?
any examples of ? anyone?
or if ya homie can't go home cause he a little intoxicated
my homies just shower me with a water hose in their front yard then change my clothes and take me home
the birther lie is what turned trump from an ordinary reality tv star into a political figure. that origin story can't be unwritten.
bitch please. you started that shit now own it.
i wonder why blocked me. i never insulted or misrepresented him. was i too critical of his former boss?
i accidentally discovered i was blocked by &amp; have no clue why... odd
. is unboxing!
don't do it! 6s plus forever!
q9: how will you describe innovation? does it affect the way startups define value to customers?
startups should always be able to express their value to customers. if they can’t, they are done for.
i’m no roman fan, but they came away from last night thinking that the offense was the problem?

but what good is the ledger if people ignore it? can't imagine trump supporters care about that.
agree. that's why the ux and social experience around such ledger really matters. that's what we're working on at .
i really hope it isn't in order. if it was though melos in the right spot.
if it's going from worst to best then he definitely is
let's be clear: just admitted that he peddled fake conspiracy theories to attack the integrity of .
no he blamed it on hillary...he said he put an end to it....my god.
ummmm the really fired greg roman? wow. scapegoat much? and he was the nfl's highest-paid oc. i do not agree w/ that decision. at all

while largely correct on hillary and birtherism, trump has used egregious conspiracy theory tactics over and over
types are all plunging with ever increasing velocity into the tar pit of irrelevance. irreversible.

we believe the two biggest problems nigerian startups have are 1. executing the business idea and 2. "funding"
everyone complains about funding, but the bigger problem is executing.
lori! this is amazing.
librarian i left message with was like, "...uh-huh, snappsy the alligator. okay, i'll let him know."
and not just angela--before her, was attacked and it was met with a lot of silence.
it's easier, isn't it? easier to call out literal nazis than a beloved white author. easier to rally around a white lady than a black one.
credit card. cc. do your homework if your gonna be with her. you may be considered an accomplice
i have no idea what you are talking about, i'm sure it is more important than you using a fake picture.
trump's event to announce the first black president is a citizen is like making a point of saying a jewish candidate does not own the media.
plus it was just an advertisement for his new hotel anyway.
well hello to you.
i knew i shouldn't have preordered
go see these folks put a great show on for you while you can!
is this a show you really think represents diversity on stage? when i saw it there were two black actors: a minstrel &amp; a hag.
while i wholly agree with brandon and david... i think the point of rr4 is devex for the masses
it's a clean and easy to understand, easy to reason about api. there are edge cases, sure.
excellent piece by for , w- some very smart comments from my friend
thank you shadi and john.
just told a group of high schoolers about the time i consumed nothing but taco dip and mountain dew for 3 days and then i threw up.
i tried a variant of this where i had chili-cheese fritos and chewy sweet tarts for dinner. similar results.
and you know... if they have supposedly two good minded defensive coaches you would think they'd be able to look better then that
they made fitz look like some sort of legend out there last night. terrible
here i come!! so excited 🎉❤️
i'll be there for like 5 days - we'll have to meet up at some point!!
woah, grace vanderwaal, the winner of america's got talent, is from suffern, ny, right near me. pretty cool

it's sooo cheap to do a startup. sometimes you don't even need a domain name.
finally feeling better from this terrible cold i had all week so i wanted to wish u all a happy healthy friday! 👍🏻😊
happy friday to you too.
i don't think ur smart if that was ur come back . they do have a private button if you'd like to continue to talk shit privately
i'll keep this public for everyone to see how ignorant you sound. everyone already knows the shit i been through this is nothing

there are opinions across the board on that. a question that scotus would have to settle. i can't say.
happy birthday gabby! 🎉🎈🎁🎊
thank you !!! 😈
agree 100% not really acceptable. i know its hard, but we came into the league knowing that a stadium was expected
not only expected .. but promised
again, trump turns his faults on others. psychologists call it "projecting." kids call it "i'm rubber, you're glue."
he is not lying, you are as usual.
big time now!!! congratulations!!
excited to rep brooklyn &amp; our terriers at the national level!

only took him five years to change his mind. does not say much for his character.

i just can't afford the room this time 😞 my heart is sad guys .
were not getting a room.........
it's easier, isn't it? easier to call out literal nazis than a beloved white author. easier to rally around a white lady than a black one.
and don't get me wrong, i'm so so glad we're calling out the nazis and rallying today. but. next time, when it's a black woman, be here.
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
why you do it all the time.
it's a clean and easy to understand, easy to reason about api. there are edge cases, sure.
i actually hate the jsx all the things movement. they should stop at fun experiments

you win. i'll agree to that. i should have said "simple" 🙄
which player is playing "out of position" ?
mpg plays winger, godoy plays attacking role, wondo plays false 10, thompson plays bench
i agree with that. it was. but this is incredibly precipitous and disruptive.
well, your photo says it all. we suck again.
heck yeah, do itt

how can a start with peculiar african dynamics grow by running lean?
that's a bit too general. africa is a big place. lots of different dynamics in different countries.
rex ryan's defense was also just waxed for 37 points and 493 yards by the jets.
the cbs don't suck like that and they might have one the game
i think twitter may have found it's new thing.... after i saw this tweet last night i started watching. liked it a lot
it's a pretty big game changer
let me know if he ever repented 4 his ways !
not entirely wrong, but coming from him?!smh
happy birthday to a true brother, the ulman. love you brother and so do they
have a wonderful birthday :)
😧 my face reading the article
he was doing such a good job too
how can a start with peculiar african dynamics grow by running lean?
can you be specific?
trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first african american president. he can't just take it back.
you started it there is tons of proof. question: do you ever tell the truth?
i actually hate the jsx all the things movement. they should stop at fun experiments
but react router v4 is a solid design *for the target audience*

love folks that try and nerd-splain me how i don’t understand parallelism/simd/multi-core. hard to contain my “do you know who…” response.
heh. i’ve gotten much better about that over the years when folks complain to me about api i’ve written.
as 4 me,i have this great passion for re-designing ict nd re-engineering jets in nig basic school
jets? ok...building jets takes a lot of funding. :)
nah, you put those bad ones up 😂😂✊
for sure !!
outside of those 2 bombs, offense looked enept. couldn't sustain a drive, defense on field 3/4 of the game. they had to be gased
i understand that there really weren't any sustained drives by the o but the defense even early in the game couldn't get a stop
i would have loved to be there but i couldn't make it. guess there is a doppelgänger!
maybe it was stock footage they had of protest in albany in general. it was definitely you
it really shouldn't be surprising the embarrassing state of the clinton campaign when her surrogates/supporters smear like this
you can't even bring yourself to say obama was born in the us. pathetic and sad!

getting lots of work done, right? me too.
deadass please do! ima guna shoot myself one day here
lmao you'll be alright 😂
i understand that there really weren't any sustained drives by the o but the defense even early in the game couldn't get a stop
they yielded long drive after long drive over and over again
and don't get me wrong, i'm so so glad we're calling out the nazis and rallying today. but. next time, when it's a black woman, be here.
cool side thing? that white lady author? she's trying to do better. and yesterday, a white male author apologized clean and simple.
4) i'll add an option.if you need it, i'll write you the check and you can keep the money rather than give it to charity
this is a great idea mark, will you also be doing this with or are you just trying to nail trump??
i have always been for my entire family is voting for him.
i live 4 miles from where he grew up in queens i wrote this for trump
yess you feel me ! 😭 and i'm trying to go both days but hope the new job doesn't fuck it up. oh yess 😈✊🏼

bruh we out.
and here is the clinton campaign's latest focus...will it work? how will donald trump handle?
4 men dead, our security at risk,e mail scandal,syria,kkk mentor,tavelgate. tpp flip flot and this is what you want to know?
so, how was your thursday night?
congrats liat and family!
currently listening to dr feelgood’s ‘roxette', and all is well with the world :-)
i read that wrong and was hoping for a cover of motley crue by 80s pop band roxette. :-)
seems about right. all adds up.
the offense is awful and predictable, tyrod regressed. see ya, greg!
customer service delivery is paramount important, the place of abode, livelihood
yeah..channels for service delivery are a big challenge in most of the african startups i've talked to.
to make matters worse, i’m colorblind. how untrustworthy is that.
your likes are v appreciated because i definitely think of you every time i hear this song. read into that whatever you will.
it's been said before, but dems have expressed a lot of trump outrage (justifiably) w/o adequately addressing anxieties fueling him. (1/2)
what dems r u talking to? we've been screaming about racial resentment for years
so to recap: bills fired oc greg roman and promoted asst hc anthony lynn to new oc, per league sources.
ok,well that doesnt make much sense,they scored 31pts last night,its the 37pts that the d let up that cost them the game,lol
trump calls cosmo reporter who interviewed ivanka "very rude" and "non-intelligent" for doing her job:

other room was actually same floor just to the side. this booth had a small stairway maybe 6 steps up and looked out on main
got it. doesn't sound like a convenient layout.
cool side thing? that white lady author? she's trying to do better. and yesterday, a white male author apologized clean and simple.
these call outs to big beloved names--they are so hard. but they give those folks you love a chance to grow and stay beloved.
something trump has never done.
to be a pedant, actually two things: he's never worked as a government employee, either.

as a startup, how do i know the right metrics to help grow the business?
what type of startup and what metrics are you currently tracking?
.: if donald trump wins, "it's the greatest f— you to anybody"
then he better push through the 28th amendment: the right to free psychiatric care.
gazpacho is a raw, cold soup, had it in some vegetarian/organic/raw restaurants here,fresh &amp; tasty,great for the summer.
yes. i like it in winter, too.
as a startup, how do i know the right metrics to help grow the business?
b2b? b2c? c2c? etc. what industry?
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
right after you do. and while your at it....apologize to the benghazi families
there's some truth to that
it shouldn't have to be like that, it's why a lot of relationships don't work out. someone always cares more
...wish we had syntax for named argument curried functions in js.
of you wish it, that puts it at stage 1, right? 😉

i've said it live on stream with you, but thanks tho
oh, ok. you admit trump is a conspiracy theorist? didn't you also say you'd vote for a 9/11 truther?
bills are desperate. i liked roman. he wasnt very good past 2 games, but he did a lot last year. i smell infighting more than performance
rex wants his boys around him. he's feeling heat. i dunno. probably won't matter in long run imo.

will bruno get a well deserved raise this year?
i will +1 for that!!!
for me, hamilton would work, but i would need to get done with everything by hurricane or i'd just sink into a heap of sad.
so you need to write like you're running out of time.
these call outs to big beloved names--they are so hard. but they give those folks you love a chance to grow and stay beloved.
but most importantly, they make safer spaces for marginalized people in this community and in the world at large.
i don't care what it looks like. it is the 'peoples' obligation/responsibility to question our leaders.
agreed, but it works better if you ask smarter questions like why romney &amp; mccain didn't challenge obama's eligibility?

is lean recommended alternative to raising, and how does it impact on the growth part
lean reduces cost per iteration. it does not eliminate need for funding or say "be cheap"

this kind of thing happens in more casual realms as well. god forbid you ask about attendance as a newbie

maybe after &amp; other media pay back millions in additional ad revenue from increased ratings. so, never.
the campaign is still live, yes.
i got a project ive been working on that may fit the campaign
apologize for what? i just said it is the pp's obligation/responsibility to question our leaders. all pp.
apologize man-to-man for questioning his right to be president.

my feeling: roman got the axe for the qb rex coveted not becoming a better qb. can't give up on taylor, so they gave up on roman.
let's be real, the defense looks better even when it is injured, gilmore and darby had uncharacteristically bad performances

"it felt like watching a dictator be 'fun' on state-run tv" is the most accurate and terrifying take i've seen (h/t )
i honestly can't get over this. that picture of jimmy tousling trump's hair will be in history books.

donald trump backed off birther claims: "president barack obama was born in the united states, period.”
blood no longer comingout oftrump's eyes,wherever, aboutobama's usabirth, &amp;'apologize'isn't coming out of his mouth.never does.
a source says trump broadcast pool just erased tape of his tour of the hotel in protest of bait-and-switch w no editorial access.
so now the broadcast pool has platte river network working for them too! did they use bleachbit? please report!
they just added unnecessary stuff for the most part, complicated easy functions. i'm mostly angry about the music app

was it also racism when he tlkd abt ted cruz birth place or just racism cos bo is half black? ?
ted cruz was born in canada, so questioning that is normal. barack was born in us, so his rationale is sus.

maybe way at the outside there's yellow claw or fu manchu, but both would need super reworkings
though it'll probably just be the steel serpent or zombie elektra
what is the biggest problem you have noticed with startup teams
in other words, they have no learning goals.

the $50m+ she raised at those events can't buy away perception that she lives in a bubble and doesn't understand real voters' lives. (3/2)
she made the comments previously at an interview beforehand too
just reacting to the example you cited
i can cite examples from working at drag shows too.

yup. i saw a bus dropping people off to get in line. lol

he's basically just a big evil science hydra-type organization (there are a lot of those in comics) centered in asia
he fought shield a lot in the late '60s &amp; '70s
i read the books while you were still in diapers, son. i learned my lessons from machiavelli, not martin.

flush with water. and get a no sugar brand.
i hate it when i accidentally go to the apple store and accidentally buy things 🙄
just like how i accidentally order munchery. such a travesty.
ok i’m sorry but they know filing foia requests is free, right?
time is money

i broke down nearing broad street and i've now taken shelter in a very bizarre and empty alleyway
i really have no desire to go to vegas anymore tbh... i'd so much rather take an exotic vacation with that $$ or travel throughout europe
which brings me to the point that like all that money u spend in vegas you can do so much with traveling elsewhere
but this congressional black caucus reaction is awesome!
what is it? i haven't seen anything!
2016 11" retina macbook (the usb-c one that isn't pro or air)

yeah, pretty exciting times for africa i think. next 10 years will be really interesting.

would you apologize for your right to question? that's crazy.
asking the question was fine--spending 5 years refusing to accept the obvious answer was demented.

i stg every single person on my twitter tl today is a personerd
you're surprised by this?
and you seem to be falsely accusing d-rose of "rape". there was no "rape", nor any accusation.
she is simply a scorned prostitute. where the fuck did u get the conclusion of "rape" from?
, hillary started that conspiracy. so you for bernie?
that's not true.
his kingdom is not of this world and those making of him e.g. a social-political revolutionary don't know what they're talking about
“do unto others” vs. battle &amp; belittle—the walking embodiment of pre-christian might-is-right, f*ck/fight. seems pretty clear.
no good come come from being away at boarding school.
no good at all! his folks didn't even use the jet to fetch him home for holidays.

in an ironic moment trump's set and backdrop just collapsed inside his hotel. no one hurt.
pretty sure the set and backdrop were completed ahead of time and under budget.
people are weird and isolated events sometimes blow up but like just comparing it to a year of cnn pretending trumps not a nazi
yeah, it's a fair point!! this business has gone on way too long.
you gotta watch the actual video for the song "featuring" snoop dogg

btw these two just met on the bus i'm on, and seat mate doesn't seem keen to talk. this has become more of a lecture than discussion.
fair. but what makes you tyrod will be a better qb under lynn?
guess that is a wait and see kind of question. but i would bet going more spread will help tyrod
and i'm going to hazard a guess that she's never been the hand's ultimate weapon in the comics?
she's led them on occasion but never as some super zombie woman no
i can’t see what ever waste of digital space that jonathan cheban tweeted and the kardashians quoted and i really shouldnt care but i do

since 1995, only four teams with the best regular-season record have won the world series

last weekend the beaumont bulls in texas took a knee now they are being required to stand

those are fair and valid points.
if greg roman was greg "ryan", somehow i think he keeps his job today.
david "bobo" brooks. , you owe the nation for foisting this moron upon us.
my comment to times was published "david no mention of slavery? how come?"
how? also while having my heart broken and trying to pick up the pieces? how tf honestly??!!???
like i literally don't know how i did it and the more i think about it the more overwhelmed i feel
that stunt was the most vile, insulting thing i’ve seen this campaign season.
stop letting the trumpettes like kayleigh and corey minimize it on your show.
can i roll back from ios 10? my phone can no longer update apps as it won't connect to itunes store 😡
not an ios 10 issue - same for me on ios 9. itunes is just fucked today
i think people like him should get in if worthy but no ceremony, no jacket, no press.
this seems fair. also put a red r footnote next to his name. a scarlet letter of sorts
yes but a lot of our onboarding is done offline which makes it hard to know the value of cac at times
no, thats fine. write down the offline process. find pieces to automate. still measure conversion %

a6 it sets an example to others of what kindness can do, sharing our blessings goes a long way!
reporters shouting out questions, asking trump why it took him so long to say obama was born here. he doesn't answer any.
ashley, why are you not focusing on pow/mia recognition day? why can't the clintonnewsnetwork recognize that gold star mom?
i'm really trying to act softer (i need to survive this lab group) but this zionist yt man still acts so uncomfortable &amp; passive aggressive

i swear to god twitter is bananas today.
for those asking, someone is in my mentions telling me victoria schwab was bullied into apologizing which...i feel insults victoria.
hell jimmy wasn't even cosigning none of trump's nonsense so wtf are you guys bitching about?
he's supposed to just pimpslap trump upside the head and tell him to fuck off, i think.
honestly just responded to what i heard on the radio. but yeah, they're wrong too
i think it's time to listen to a good podcast instead..............
my brother was telling me about bobby schmurda being sentenced 7 years before i went to bed so i had a dream that i was his lawyer 😂

okay lol i'm confused but i'll agree
appears as tho roman is out. game is just too fast for his schemes. better fit collegiately.
agree fully. why i rt'd. i've been saying this about him for years.
i didn't like tidal at all and i'm okay with spotify

ahh! thank you. i thought it was the day kevin seemed clearly upset over not sounding excited over concert tix.
you're right, that did play friday, because it was one of the best of kevin's meltdowns. for that see the june 21st cast.
ima sit on his face dassit
no we don't fw brothers period 🙄💯
i didn't like tidal at all and i'm okay with spotify
actually invests in the artists projects, so artists can be more creative and have more freedom to do things.
nobody, besides linda starr and philip berg. linda, who was a volunteer and large donor who helped organize campaign events. no?
berg &amp; starr were 2008 hrc "supporters". they did not work or speak for the campaign or hrc. supporters. just like duke to trump.
i talked with derrick rose's rape accuser for 90 minutes last night. this is her story in her own words.
you mean that you spoke with the prostitute who is suing d-rose. check your ignorance.
q6 why is it important to give back to people in need? ad
a6 we have all been down a hard road, and giving back is one way to say thank you to those who helped us
the fix: today a new low for journalism but for trump, he was the ringmaster at the circus. "it was peak trump."
it's amazing how his ppl behind him find all this amusing..
update: i have my phone, but they're trying to figure out a bug with the upgrade program. they're talking with someone from hq about it 👍
and my iphone 6s plus battery is down to 9%, after only 4 hours of use 🙃
i like him a lot but we good lol
put one more genius in the room why not..that's what i love about chip.. the whole offensive staff has diff background
it's taking all of my willpower not to skip straight to the post-show when it promises "a special john siracusa rant".
oh, it's so worth it. and fwiw while i sympathize with i ultimately think will win the bet.
can't wait for the day when my grades/ future don't rest upon how well i can deal with a passive aggressive shitty zionist white man 😖
and no, i can't document this shit and bring it to admin and expect them to care. lol. this is life.

yeah she kinda sucked in the netflix show.
she's not that great in the comics either, i mean her defining comic moments are when she gets killed
watch: republican gov. kasich explains why he is at the white house to "support something that the president wants."
this is american values. this is patriotic. thank you gov. kasich!

i actually did cite a different example as well from when i saw sharon needles make light of overdosing
football brunch sunday or are you leaving too early?
family brunch. maybe football after?
for a second i thought they were going to have a female do something heroic when kate ran toward where the gun landed. but...no.
what a refreshing change that would be
obama has had more muslims killed than trump. who's the bigger islamophobe?
- trump says he's using nukes. he's into really getting his numbers high.
i just know when i play melee with bad posture i get fat knots in my back and that shit hella hurts.
the struggle
just gonna...style...this one out...
with the cat memes, your new freelancing approach is assured!:)

oh, goodness. i know you didn't just post this on twitter. well, that's the end of this contest, lol.
whoops, my bad. you were looking good. want me to delete? for you i will.
. veteran wins gold in archery at rio 2016 paralympic games
very cool. congrats!
i was giving the benefit of the doubt, that maybe the tweet was unrepresentative, but nope. so that's cool.
oh damn. i know just as many hard-core female baseball fans than male fans. this is horseshit.
hi parents! as of right now, only about half of our classrooms have a room parent! what is a room parent you ask?...
do we have to be a parent of a child in class? or a volunteer from community? missing
did david duke donate or volunteer time with trump? the only people who talk about duke are liberals. republicans hate him too
no because trump won't speak about it. he doesn't have a good answer.
thanks for the follow christian!
looking forward to your tweets
is the monday meetup w/ going to be archived? cc:
no, there are no current plans to film this meetup.
am i the only one who likes the firing of greg roman? offense has been putrid over 2 weeks outside of a couple big plays tyrod made.
i don't disagree actually. the "bad d" was a weird day for the secondary.
healthy relationships form healthy lives
thanks fir sharing my article.
bamm! just pulled the "birther" rug from underneath hillary's cankled legs
the only thing that orange clown pulled was bullshit out of his old, withered ass!
so is anyone mad we fired the oc that came out with complete trash game plans? he's making hc money. roman failed w// his antiquated offense
roman was too cute for his own good.
chris brown's "autumn leaves" is pretty good. and kendrick doesn't actually ruin it like i thought he would.
...i think i spoke too soon wait.
here's where our sports writers will be on this football friday.
last week's tweet was more colorful. this one is nice and sleek though.
awesome week:1st delivers presidential unsc resolution on , now running w/
thanks your turn to deliver the real action next week!
"your view is wrong cus this guy called me a pussy &amp; he agrees with you" isn't great logic imo.
i've made lots of points but that's one. you don't think it's telling to note who one agrees with?
what we saw today will be every day of a trump presidency. but with, you know, lives at stake.
the media has to take some responsibility. especially fox
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
regardless, if you take someone's car, and the car is reported stolen, u will be arrested if police find you driving said car.
gonna be late for work cuz i had to pet this puppy for nearly 10 min 😭
always acceptable 🐶
oh, goodness. i know you didn't just post this on twitter. well, that's the end of this contest, lol.
also if clothes are out, what should our next contest be?
pelase if you have epilepsy/ur bad w flashing colours dont wthc the leopard eys mv dsjhgf it almost gave me seizures as well

nah babe it's still going on till 4
it's naptime! today's listen: "dualmono minuetsequels" on midori records (mi24)
!where it all started back in 2007!
please do not search my mentions to find this person.
but like, when an adult tries to set things right, i just feel like it's the height of wackness to try to walk back their apology.
if we discuss death, we actually have to accept that we are mortal and we all die. we are all, often, in denial about this.
yes. we all must face our mortality. sometimes i get 'the look' because i will say "i will bury my daughter".
so stoked for these dudes headed to slo rn. kill it down there and i'll visit real soon.
thanks maxxy✊🏼
everybody had an opinion on the durant move but i didn't hear a peep about this lil "can you hear me now" verizon dude sprint flip flop
sprint didn't beat verizon.
why you gotta fight with me at cheesecake
you'd be surprised on how many people fight at olive garden 😂
don't really care about nms but the lead developer outright said it was gonna be an mmo, it's not surprising that people thought that.
really? where? at most, he said “yes, but that’s incredibly unlikely” when asked if players might bump into each other…
i put mascara on my eyebrows before in accident and i looked like a chola
lucky i had enough time to fix mine😂😩
q7 when's your next trip to walmart to pick up great value milk, del monte fruit fusions, lender's bagels? ad
a7 sunday when we do our grocery shopping!
i've been here for 3 hours already, and got here 15 minutes before my appointment.
youre still here?!? didn’t they take you inside like and hour ago?
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
it has no relevance whether a person was drunk or not when they let you "borrow" their car. however, u did say you "took" the car
this was me 😩
what did you end up doing? lol i'm lowkey pissed i might act like tomrw is a normal day lol
when you realize that everything springs only from yourself, you will learn both peace and joy. hh dalai lama
so it looks like neveradmitmistakes trump incapable of learning peace &amp; joy.
but reggie loves book gets into it a little
i'll check that out, but there is definitely a difference between staffers floating a bad idea and the campaign acting on it.
bring this up on the 24th! let's get everyone sharing! :)
check this out
what is going on? i come in to be like 'yo i got a new haircut happy friday and then:" o_____o???
i bet your haircut is great though!
greg roman just feels like a john fox guy. loves to run the football and has been really good at it as an oc.
i trust dowell loggains, but lets say he fails, bringing roman in would pair he and fangio back together
what are you talking about that movie was dee best
um goodbye there was too much feet going on there
i can't tell which girls are straight and which aren't anymore.
either way i wanna kiss y'all

def carry around cash. enjoy japan! 日本楽しんでください！😊
djs - what's the worst confrontation you ever had with a requester?
just before closing my set, the resident dj came up and introduced himself to me as "who hired you?"
can't stress how much i both love and how much i disagree with this. does article say pulling was wrong?...
polling is a directed art. questions, demographics, intent are the ingredients.
...on the bright side, there's still hope for the future. 🙏🏾 i'm optimistic about the igeneration.
yo 😰😭😭😭 ...there's literally nothing in the world that hurts my heart more than ppl being forced to eat alone
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
agreeing to let someone borrow a car =/= the car is yours. for the car to be yours, you'd need to transfer the title.
you got a lil cute booty😂💕(hella weird/random)
lmao girl i live for compliments on my non existent ass 😩💘💘 thank youuu 😂
lame ass bitches actin' brand new. fuck you and everything you stand for.
hate when that happens
well maybe shouldn't have takin' so long to get it out to the public, nor was he the only one questioning
do you believe that mccain and romney were too stupid to notice that obama was not eligible to run?

super pumped to see everyone's shots on sept 29th!
please please please have andy on as a guest reviewer.

well, then you must be both pretty stupid and racist.
is it wrong that i'm bothered that they got big so fast?
technically it's been a couple years before they made it big but as i die hard fan i'm bothered a bit too

😮 i not so secretly love that show! so cool!
so you're on twitter telling me to go to . i wonder what thinks about that
twitter is not easy for in depth conversations!
i myself had doubts. only because the media made a big deal out of it instead of saying it's the pp's duty
doubts that he war born in the us?
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
ok...there is an exercise to generate customer personas, but i can't do that on twitter. hold on.

everyone has to rt this
confirming what american ppl knew 8+ yrs ago when they elected the .
indeed! now trump needs to focus on the real issue: is ght really a native nyer?
the time baby wanted this pandora ring so i had the waiter serve it to her with the rest of our breakfast.
how romanticccccc
hillary calls on trump 2apologize for his birther remarks. will she apologize 4 her staff spreading that rumor when she ran vs obama in '08?
pants on fire. you should be ashamed of yourself. it was not started by staff.
1. loco 2. yadda yadda ft. 3. 100 $pank$ 4. hold on ft. n 5. flip 6. hood n***a ft.
sounding like a movie. what time is your set? lol how i have every song memorized
but but but... politifact fact checked it!!!!
ha! politifact sucks. this we know. i'd just never seen any evidence to the contrary on this specific thing.
am i the only one who likes the firing of greg roman? offense has been putrid over 2 weeks outside of a couple big plays tyrod made.
if the d looks better as the season goes on, might seem like the right call. lynn better pull something out of his ass though
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
u neglect to deal with facts. the fact is that the car's title is not in your name, thus u could possibly be arrested if driving.

i'm working rn anyway hit me when u on tho
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
try this article for starters:
papers please mr. trump. i want to see your letter from the i.r.s. indicating audit status. i have no proof.
don't expect sponge bob square pants to produce any tax papers cause he lives on tv
no. just a little misstep✌🏻️

i agree with hillary.
did you even see the game? just two offensive series with more than 6 plays... just two... you know how many were vs ravens? 2.
i saw the 37 points that got hung on their defense that has cratered under rex. plays per drive is useless

hillary's support is like spring ice on a lake. looks solid, but don't stand on it.
weekend at bernies
pepe the frog, david duke, now - hillary clinton is a horrible candidate running a horrible campaign. period.
and your candidate is a filthy, racist, bold-faced liar.
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
end of the day, you just need to start by guessing and start eliminating different segments you try.
. calling for a cohort of colleagues at !
we're that cohort!
i'm going be here with you brother
the real kno wassup
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
if you agreed to return the car in one hour, &amp; you neglected to return the car, you could be arrested for theft if police catch u
the truth is the truth, no matter how painful or horrific.
it's in that painful truth that we learn what the human condition is - our vulnerability.

marley got his oil changed, a full tank, &amp; now he bouta get his eye fix. lol
i hate how we personify him 😭😭
wanna know something "funny?" until right now, thought it was "like the corners" not "light." you taught me something - again.
you two are blowing my mind right now.
trump has the electoral college advantage, not clinton
hmmm - 538 says only that there is a very low possibility of either winning without popular vote. trump’s is slightly less low.
you could also start with their playbook:
maybe i'm missing a beat, but that seems to relate to the "he's a muslim" conspiracy stuff, not the birther stuff.
what part of its over don't you understand.
if you are assaulted, after the assault, it is over. is that your position?
i didn't like tidal at all and i'm okay with spotify
so overall they can provide a much better experience, ie chance, frank, etc.
ain't you in ny? i do want to work w ny ems
so come through.
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
this is called generative research...all you need to do is start and then get new ideas about who to talk.
drive to her house with his friends and the other party is blackout (not in a reasonable state of mind), it's not consent!
"not in a reasonable state of mind" is your opinion. it is not a fact that a drunk person is "not in a reasonable state of mind".
the fired their oc greg roman. but the put up 37 on the . rob ryan was atrocious w/the . am i missing something?
exactly what i thought. rex is like trump, blame others for his family's problems
hada ion wan hear it niggas did it to they self
mar your way better then that thou 😒

working my ass off to leave things settled but something tells me my phone will still be blowing up with work calls this weekend 😒
there is an off button
this literally hurts so fucking bad oh my god
suck it up damn don't you drink vegetables or something
pot, meet kettle lady u can't stand unassisted never mind stand up 2 anything 😂😂
you are making yourself irrelevant. afraid of losing p as president. thats all you care about
you could also start with their playbook:
not that that makes it remotely ok, and not that they two are unrelated, but it doesn't disprove what politifact wrote.
ah! so that’s why you asked ;-). ok, good trick. now, a serious q: will there be recordings? or is this a live only tool/platform?
will check..
can please start a twitter poll to see who started ?
buwhahahahahaha... the republicunts started the birther bs because they're racist, ignorant assholes...
ordering prints/business cards for awa / nycc.. i'm going to bed now, honest.
see you in a few hours
or my talk on wednesday :)
absolutely. anything to help the ecosystem grow.
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
only way you can screw up is by sitting on your ass in your office. just go start talking to anyone.
i wonder if he has a sock puppet monkey
i'm going home i don't need this today!!!!!!!!
and btw, trump referred to me as "him" and said he did not read the interview.
has anyone ever attacked trump non-viciously? it's 0 or 100 with that guy!
. offers trump $10m for a one-on-one interview with "no one else in the room to help"
i'll channel the donald for a tenth of that :)
writing fire was all and headline fire i believe goes to
kudos to you all for the 🔥
briefly i thought "man seth roger got ripped"
rogen, obviously
. summed it up on cnn, calling trump's event today the political equivalent of a rick roll, which is pretty funny.
sopan, have not found you as part of the but it is well documented that is in bed with the dnc
guess which of the three cables news nets has aired no part of the cbc event on trump's birtherism?
guess they think who killed jonbenet is more important.they should just ask boulder p.d..they know.
ok last question, i have a new product b2b around customer support but cust dec is hard cuz i don't know who i should be talking to
talk to 5 smbs today and see where you are by tomorrow.

such an aggressive term considering they improved a bunch
i think some ppl go overboard with healthy food for kids, as long as limit sugar &amp; balance food should be ok
agreed - that's why i'm ok with them having pancakes/cereal/what have you. (i don't give syrup to the 2yo, though.)
which campaign staff of hillary clinton's questioned barack obama's birth certificate?
pathetic how trump exploits the stupidity of his gullible supporters. they think he's their friend, just the opposite.
this is a good tweet adam
i have my moments!

hi there, just tested this on my end in multiple browsers — infinite scroll of video recs is loading for me... (1/2)
oh, and the whole android texting thing is fixed. thanks to great it'ing at hr!
you'll enjoy this read mainly: "“i mix and record everything on an old reel-to-reel tape machine,”
"occasionally i will bring home a jalapeño."
specifically sounds like america - midwest...my voice may or may not be included ;)
oooo! will do, thank you for the rec!
i prolly wont even be able to attend bc of timezones smh
i'd adjust my schedule just for you 😩
hey i told a friend about and he was so pumped!

i have the idea that these people like natural gas - dunno. look like hacks, i follow data instead
oh, bti? not sure if they're bought into "bridge fuel" concept. nukes are their main gig. hacks indeed.
it's like if you were blackout drunk and i asked if i could take your car and you said yes. your car is mine now?
the relevant fact would be that police find you in possession of a car that was reported stolen.
buying and drinking but in retrospect no reason for a school to have one.
yup - sam's school just has water vending machines and fountains for filling bottles. that's good.

donald trump said pregnancy is very inconvenient for businesses, like his mother's pregnancy hasn't been inconvenient for the whole world.

many use traditional delivery channel s where they can't link the spend to results
that's a challenge. i don't like those channels because of that problem. you need big scale there.
appears to have won the soundbite award of the day re: trump's event/statement. my story on the hill:
joe your a reasonable guy. what is it people like about trump?
“we got played, again, by the trump campaign.” — john king just now on cnn.
better go read it matt
my dad was born in poland. do you know how many people ever asked me whether or not i was born in america? nobody ever asked me that.
me either, and my mom was born in germany.
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
you should apologize for your endless lies to american people, fbi and congress
what happened to abraham his rich friend?
abraham had faith and it was counted to him for righteous. he was willing to kill his only son in obedience he wasn't asking
you got the 🔑
girl, "all night" just came on. yeah. i did something right.
and using the hyphen breaks the hashtag. this shows a lack of knowledge in twitter and apple
exactly. it’s awful.
guess what! that's not what consent is sexually! if one party is relatively sober or sober enough to make the decision to
sober vs non-sober is subjective, and entirely inconsequential to consent.
uh guys that's not how this meme works

now i have tweet envy. 👏
wouldn't resort to it unless your case is really weak or unless you wanna shame the guy you're arguing with.
it's "consider the attitude of many people who agree with you... and examine whether you want to stand w/them."
do i talk to coys who would eventually pay for the product or to customers who have the problem of getting support.....
talk to people who have the problem for starters. then look for people who have the problem, know they have the problem...

ui vs artist initiative are two different things. that's up to the record labels etc
true, but apple also is putting in more money than labels. like they paid for drake to have an extra long set at staples
do i talk to coys who would eventually pay for the product or to customers who have the problem of getting support.....
you are looking for people who are looking for a solution. :)
remember when trump tweeted all three of these accusations on the same day?
this is silly😏
what happened to abraham his rich friend?
god to give him financial stability, he obeyed that's why god blessed him. and mind you that was a picture of jesus christ too
where's trump after his disgusting lies? of course at rnc hq in dc where he is always embraced. can you hear our cbc members trump?
he's pandering to african americans. i hope they remember all the other hateful things he said about obama.
i'll save you a seat!!
i'll be watching and brof... viewing party in temecula!!
i'm still working so therefore send info so perhaps i can sneak away while in williamsburg.

sober vs non-sober is subjective, and entirely inconsequential to consent.

the of is backing a that delivers cooked 🗽🍔🍟🎯
. thanks for the umi love💚
sent this to spox, to ask how he will fulfill promise to give $5m if assured pres. obama born in us
boom!!!!!!! he will need a loan for that.
instead of asking "do you remember me?" say "hi, my name is ---- we met a few years ago at ----" the cartoonist will thank you!
also please say "we met..." not "i met you..." so rude, as if it was a one-way experience. hear it everyday.
yep this album is a banger. on repeat today.
yes!! was pleasantly surprised at how good this album is.
send me the details and we'll try cutie! by the way, my guy coal says hi! kris.sanchez.com
it was last night but no worries. we are editing a short video. it was amazing. will send to you.
"he won't release tax docs, so we can't know what he's worth" hahaha you've got me rolling 😂😂 tax returns do not show net worth...
c’mon you know it will show enough info that he doesn’t want revealed. let’s not play that game i respect you at least do same
yeah just be mindful. maybe on a day you give pancakes you say no cookies eat fruit/veggies as snack. i think it's important also
yup. there's also no drink options here other than milk and water.
liberal writers trying to edit old articles where they wrote about starting with
no, that would be the orange babbling buffoon's (no offense to the buffoons) team.he's the culprit.
joe your a reasonable guy. what is it people like about trump?
short answer: he's not a politician. and comes across as candid even when facts aren't in line.
i'm done ur stupid yall started &amp; keep tweeting shit just stfu already with the tweets and i wouldnt be here to say something
finally i thought you would never stop seesh
rogue swen are doing a christmas werkend together

out curiousity really # a delibrate business model or a lack resources tht births innovation or both?
either way. innovation comes from the spontaneous collision of divergent ideas.
there are much larger issues to tackle, however.
what larger issues?
what happened to abraham his rich friend?
and i hope you're born again asking all these questions because that's the only way to get to heaven
yeah i'm thinking the bills are thinking the same thing
couldn't agree more, sam! jags should have taken him 3rd overall in 2014 instead of bortles, stunk again and got jameis!!

i dropped the kids at daycare and returned to find car battery dead. scrabble to fix it or take this opportunity to nap in car?

what a great invention the honking car alarm was. such a lovely touch in an urban environment.
and effective too
please let me know when you do i definitely want one, possibly 2
aight. i will.
guess what! that's not what consent is sexually! if one party is relatively sober or sober enough to make the decision to
there is no such thing as "sober enough to make the decision". there is only the fact that a decision was or wasn't made.
well-played by the master!!! msm outraged after trump tricks them to cover endorsements from military heroes
man outraged too bad msm ! clever is more like it. thats how he will do the deal as potus.

i just watch the trailer of and im already a fan of you, cant wait to watch the show!!!!
thank you, so glad you like it!! hopefully someone picks us up soon and there will be plenty more to come 😊
read the memos. it's one of the strategy points. penn proposes targeting obama’s “lack of american roots.”
that sounds more like flat-out racism than birhterism. "lack of roots" is a smear applied to immigrants very frequently.
they already offered those schools, plus air force - they all said no.
i think with the lifeboat out to see and the american's perception was best of the rest, it's more favorable
i don't even know what it is &amp; i can't wait. lol
bet it's the partner hopefully soon
he can always ride his unicorn named "adjusted ebitda"

there is no such thing as "sober enough to make the decision". there is only the fact that a decision was or wasn't made.

to tell kids why these decisions are made so they get into habit themselves of thinking when to treat themselves
that's the most important aspect of it. eating nutritious foods needs to become habit.

spending nearly all my slack time on this channel. amazing productivity improvement!
this is a great guide helps narrow down who i'm talking to
good, i think i have some more articles on on personas, but that is a good one by a friend.
i am truly honored and grateful for receiving so much support from our american heroes...
i listened 2 the entire press conference. as a veteran, i really appreciat.their kind words+strong support they all gave u
they left you
my manager didnt want to give my the days off to go
he's gonna give me a spare copy of getting started in electronics for my kids; raising next gen of makers!
very exciting! 🙌
leading the birther movement is deplorable. attempting to say it "did a great service" to the president who trump attacked is asinine.
you should be reminded of your lies and innuendo
that did work out nicely. what did you do with the extra time last night?
i wish i had a better answer than 'fuck all'.
but what about the sorry piece of cheese toast
that made my soul cry.
isn't it terrible business for a political candidate to open a high profile business in dc? doesn't he guarantee no dem customers?

when i got my iphone 4, i pulled an all-nighter in line from 1am or so. brought two bottles of 🍷&amp; cups, made a party 🎉 of it 😆
apparently you need to camp out for preorders now too. used to be instant pickup.
that sounds more like flat-out racism than birhterism. "lack of roots" is a smear applied to immigrants very frequently.
saying "he's too foreign to vote for" is despicable, but not the same as saying he's literally ineligible due to birth.
there are times that i look at and i get angry because his jokes are so beautiful and i will never possess them.
you are my life, you are my breath, i love you. let me have you.
i'm pretty sure i got curved, better try again just to be safe
an update: yes, i was curved lol
question? who started the birther issue in 2016 pres election? we know hillary campaign started in '07
did hillary clinton start the obama birther movement? via
roberto firmino misses out for tonight due to a minor groin strain
well there goes my fantasy team. spent good money on him last week too.
you're more than welcome to go to clinton campaign and ask for an apology. they played very dirty in 2008 campaign.
lol, it's sad when you support someone that you can't defend without deflection. i see your done, take care..✌
i'm tired of it being curly tho
do it like sunday its gnna get puffy and then u just gnna end up wetting it again
will do! :) awesome and very helpful interview, lori! can't wait to read your new books!
thank you both! 😘

why is it so hard to find good genuine people
i'm a good genuine person
thank you! i can't wait for you to read it either! :)
i always support good books and friends, so i'll definitely help spread the word!

thanks for the kind words and rt - hope you and andy are doing well.
lmao sorry i couldn't do the punch rally lmao
it's okey. you still gave me some footage to work with which is all i needed in the end.
ricky was going to cook us home made ribs, mac &amp; cheese, and corn on the cobb but it's going to be 95 degrees. oven on? nah.
just stick to beers and tacos.
is it acceptable to silent treatment your mom if she votes trump knowing full well that her daughter is considered a jew to neo nazis?
the reason you are considered a jew is because you think drunk sex "is rape".

no work hmm?
are you saying these buildings need to be redesigned? 😉
and what is the new representation for flash storage? and are these buildings now just "spinning rust"?
they also did that too. people forget how racist and full of dog whistles the '08 campaign was.
for sure. but again, that's not birhterism. if you're arguing it fed the same shitty racist impulses, then yech, agreed.
i already feel old af, though. 😂😂
i'm older than both of yall.. shush
and i really hate the language in the article from the so-called nutritionist. 'cheese *counts* as a meat.' ugh.
what. oh hell no.
trump has admitted falsehood about obama. i give rudy credit for pushing. hrc has been sick,but bither-ism has been sicker. 5 years of lies.
but he perpetrated a new lie in the process. why should he get kudos for this?!

they're riding the "alive" train straight into the ground honestly
i got some of this back when. ppl felt i was just covering my ass. which is their right, they don't owe me faith. still. 😞
i get the impulse to not trust when hurt? i also get the impulse to protect a fave. but just, ugh.

agreeing to let someone borrow a car =/= the car is yours. for the car to be yours, you'd need to transfer the title.

as for drunk people transferring title of their vehicles, i am sure it happens all the time and we would have no way of knowing.
there is no legal requirement that a person "not be drunk" in order to transfer the title of their vehicle to another party.

jesus. trump is now taking reporters "on a tour" of his hotel. this is real life?
he strong armed a cnn female reporter and wouldn't let her come. media said they won't show any pictures

there is no legal requirement that a person "not be drunk" in order to transfer the title of their vehicle to another party.

at trump's next press conference he will admit canadian pm is a "total babe".
and his policies are an improvement over previous right-winger.
clinton's campaign slogan is literally the meaning of the word "fascism"
how exactly is clinton a fascist? i'll wait.

i was just eating food outside of chipotle and a cop threatens to give me tickets because of my car being modified
your car is stock tho
this is the best moment of my life
i was the special consiglieri on this decision to "come out"
she literally accused him of rape.
no, since if she *did* "accuse him of rape", then there would be a police report. there is no report.
people filing their nails on public transport
hell if i could get just by filing my nails i'd do it on public transport too
i remember saying last year trump wouldn’t make it out of the primary. but i believed the media would treat him like everyone else
and ever since the start of that election season, the media has given him passes for every fuck mistake (w/ kid gloves).
so sad… i will but i just wish hey would get it right!
that’s. very subjective thought. you should show them who’s boss and just be like, yo, i’m gonna make your maps!
dont know anyone who can do that kind of turnaround; your best strategy, take all of client's docs, sanitize, dump into provisional

the south park national anthem episode might be the greatest thing ever.
i couldn't stop laughing
no, since if she *did* "accuse him of rape", then there would be a police report. there is no report.
if u are making such a claim, then you should be able to cite the police report filed against d-rose.
q: i don't want cookies for reporting trolls so i don't tell authors when i do, but does benefit of knowing you have support outweigh that?
i love seeing people (if they have the spoons) tweeting that they've done this, without expectation of response/thanks.
it's not a conspiracy. it's campaign tactics, smears. same as that remark as kennedy getting shot.
birtherism is a conspiracy theory, full of altered documents and cover-ups. that's different from a straight smear.
trump today: 270 words on his hotel. 67 words on birtherism.
when trump university reopens, there should be a course on trolling. djt should personally teach the master class.😂👍🇺🇸

where is this tweet? i went to their twitter feed and don't see it? i don't think bernie actually said this.
it was a paid promoted tweet. like facebook, you can run ads that are separate from your profile content.
that's really neat!
wow. i didn’t even notice this.
oddly, some people of color have doubts that america’s police have their best interests at heart.
well trump just lost the vote.
if u are making such a claim, then you should be able to cite the police report filed against d-rose.
unless there is a police report, then there is no accusation to even speak of. ergo, 'accusation' is moot.
the msnbc split screen of the cbc unleashing on trump while his plane flees washington is quite something.
i had exactly the same thought. who cares about an airplane?

you have the best tweets
this is what happens when you grovel for an interview and lose all sense of journalistic ethics. yet again, it's oz.
ethics and oz have barely a passing acquaintance.
i love seeing people (if they have the spoons) tweeting that they've done this, without expectation of response/thanks.
i think saying "no response needed, but reported" is a great way to show support and take work out of responding to mentions.
the give me something hes said in the last year that would make you think hes racist, dated a black woman for 2 years
his comment about the mexican judge was hella racist. that's just one instance off the top of my head.

whennnn????
but makes it impaosible to share their comment threads
on facebook, just tag someone, they'll get a notification to see that post
he embraced the birther movement &amp; tried to blame it on hillary...
how in the fuck does being a "birther" make you a "racist?" left wing propaganda! brainwashed parrots! lol!
i think saying "no response needed, but reported" is a great way to show support and take work out of responding to mentions.
then also, because twitter is so performative, people will see your actions and follow suit.
cry harder.
i'll wait for the videos of you and your kind bawling your eyes out when is like you did when romney lost,
here's cnn's fact-checking trump's claims about clinton starting

i am such a fan of 'poors should be grateful for this garbage' from same mentality of 'cant feed em dont breed em'
yup. same vein as "why should they be able to buy organic with food stamps?"
it was a paid promoted tweet. like facebook, you can run ads that are separate from your profile content.
yeah i know about those. i was looking for it so i could respond, but they deleted it.
trump finally admits obama was born in the u.s. what now? discusses.

he's not racists?
you're finally right. however, killary is!
if u are making such a claim, then you should be able to cite the police report filed against d-rose.
in the case, his accuser did accuse him, hence the existence of a police report.
the performative part is hard bc i don't want credit, i just want to help. but if the performance also helps...

both sides continue to talk about potus who has been in office for 8 years...why? what impact will it have for either?
only one side. trump talks about obama's failed policies which you have to in an election/you know that!!
that doesn't mean he's racist???
what doesn't mean he's a "racist?"
if you're watching a film &amp; a character has a star wars figure collection &amp; the figures all still have their guns it's not a realistic film.

in her civil suit allegations, there is nothing about an alleged "rape" occurring.
the civil suit seems to be focused on "theft of prostitution services".

we would be happy to assist you on remote work. let us know so that we can discuss further via dm. pf:
cnn did, finally:
she asked this with a smile as though the question is a dare to neutrality. you dare call him a liar?
but i mean, we all have to do what we can. there can't be the expectation of performance.
i say this as maybe the loudest asshole in the room: you can't do it all. and shouldn't.
i had the similar thought that casual is relative. (also, you look good.)
thank you! :d
trump was a birther when mitt romney proudly accepted his endorsement in 2012. you own birtherism, republicans. trump just the ringleader.
romney sold out for cash.
it'd be one thing if she was selling weed. she had a lethal painkiller. i'm not showing sympathy for that.
so hot take: she killed prince?
we're looking for an developer in for a one-off user test. dm me for details!

try a chai tea latte or just chai tea. you get just a portable cup and buy tea and make it how you like in the am.
"casual" is a state of mind
i like this! :d

there's a guy of the train knitting. his hands are tattooed variously but his knuckles say, i shit you not, "knit" and "purl."
i might have seen him once too, that sounds super familiar.

media on donald trump 'birther' news conference: 'we got played'
just like trump tricked pres. of mexico into meeting w/ him under the guise of a respectful visit. really just a photo op for trump.
i think the firing of greg roman is a bad decision, and i explain why, in full, here:
loved the last few paragraphs. feels like ownership is giving rex a chance to make it work. i wonder how long he has to do so
obamas almost out of office...no one gives a shit what trumps stance is but the media....move on. he's making u look ridiculous.
aas would disagree with u or don't they count?

of course they do, but would the establishment listen? probably not.
seems way too good to be true, also don't see her willingly giving up her shot at the iron throne..
in her civil suit allegations, there is nothing about an alleged "rape" occurring.
your blog says, "he tried to get me to do stuff via video and i said no to that”&lt;---that is not "rape".
i saw two movies the other day that had them. but maybe there are other theaters still getting them put in?

agreed. i try and think about my everyday scenarios and its not easy. if you want more battery though, beats x it is.
i think the lack of control on the airpods to skip and change volume is a big disadvantage.

money quote: “…no fire, so i think the iphone battery is quite safe.”
as a man it's tough to find other men to look up to, partly bc of pride but the way handles himself makes him someone to look up to
can appeal to people of all ages and actually uses facts when he explains his position. he may not always be right but mostly he is
guess what everyone?! said he's never experienced ... documented systemic oppression must be over now!😏
it's ironic that and are told informed views are not valid yet 's sideline comments are the "truth"?

you got the new 7?
we've reached the ultimate gas-lighting stage: no it was the democrats, even obama who were responsible for birtherism.
i call it "the unreal reality show "
a bit too convenient. though satisfying.
needs to be more drawn out though personally i'm happy for his demise to be just reported in a convo btwn susan &amp; lynda.
'z nation' is the best horror show you're not watching via
wow ok cool ok
no it's like claiming brooklyn isn't in manhattan...which it isn't
no, is right. you can't claim westwood isn't la. it is. just like bklyn is nyc.
no sorry, what i mean is they didn't delete it. you can't find promoted only tweets. they only appear in the target audience tl.
ah. ok thanks.

man,i wish i could've had the opportunity to be in a program like this 1 when i was in highschool.these kids are getting a lot of cool stuff
is funny b/c of the amount of back flips you have to do to believe obama wasn't born in the us.
also even if he wasn't "he was", he'd still be a citizen, like cruz
is a , and the
there! 10 on in one i wish there was an to say all that
will be much higher for hillary by election. i don't buy ~10% going to third party candidates
you don't? the most polarizing candidates of all time and you're saying people aren't looking elsewhere? 🤔
what is even the point
break your arm one more time and find out
chris matthews 3/4/08: "why wouldn‘t she say, of course, he‘s not a muslim. he‘s a christian."
never been any doubt obama's a muslim. why else would he surround himself with sharia law muslim brotherhood people?
he is not reeling. he will deny it tomorrow. meanwhile, no one is asking about bribes or taxes.
he tied the birtherism to his taxes in 2011. its coming
no it's like claiming brooklyn isn't in manhattan...which it isn't
and to answer your question, yes ucla is in la city.

sure but i don't think reviewers were exposed to the marketing, pr may have had its own spin
if will lie about the president of the united states, how can anyone believe a word that comes out of his big mouth?
. what trump most wants to conceal in his medical records is the clinical diagnosis that he is a pathological liar.
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
when will you ow up to your mistakes and i mean all million of them
no sorry, what i mean is they didn't delete it. you can't find promoted only tweets. they only appear in the target audience tl.
it may have already expired or stopped running. i took a screenshot bc i didn't want to give them a rt. shoulda link grabbed too :(
yo but we gon wear???
ugh you read my mind i have no idea yet. probably all black
legit feel sinister smiling at service industry people who repeatedly call me ma'am because i'm internally wanting them to choke
that must be tough, i'm sorry about the misgendering.
i think you're forgetting hillary is the queen of lying. she trumps trump in that dept. we all know that. hillary's minions.
she isn't lying. you r being misled &amp; manipulated. sorry to hear, but trump will not help u or anyone but himself.
the fix: today a new low for journalism but for trump, he was the ringmaster at the circus. "it was peak trump."
- and shame on the media for constantly giving his every move air time# feeding the monster.

when you yell at for missing ur bday party but he sends you this photo so you can't be mad anymore
is it just me or the pup is doing a sad face too?
what trump should do: for once in his life, own up to his mistakes. apologize to the president, and to the american people.
why take your advice as you are losing and he is winning and will be our next president
when hillary/all liberal media run out of issues, they turned on racism!

any days open to the public?
glad to see he's okay and onto recovery. support our men and women in blue
. how about supporting the good cops who are forced to stay quiet about corrupt cops if they want to stay alive?
don't forget how many small businesses he's bankrupted by contracting them then refusing to pay.
like obama did to thousands of coal miners
the first ice session of rookie camp is in the 📚. more to come throughout the weekend!
beside the scrimmage obviously
you're killing me with these 😂
. you're killing me...softly, with your words
me too, a sane stack would be most wunderbar.
ditto. the current stack is insane (but anything else is !linux, so a negative)
i know - that was the headline - not me :)
then someone at the needs to get it right. does not help matters to appear ignorant.
no. we are far from ok especially after facetiming alone in vegas

you didn't win anything this offseason.....

happy birthday my love!!! love you lots i hope it was a good one!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
thank you bby love u❤️
they are destroying donald trump right now, no joke❗️😳
i hope you are right. he needs to be destroyed.
interesting that the employees are essentially blaming the company for this. it's like your at mv &amp; you cheat b/c of the pressure
yes, or that it's an acceptable practice with little consequences ... until now. managers must've known but didn't say anything.
when you end up surprising each other with flume tickets 🙃🙃🙃🙃

i seen that taylor swift is dating zac efron ima just keep my comments to myself

perhaps once we're ready for international expansion.
always happy to help with writing from cafes, which is my full-time occupation too!
regrets. can you please tell us where this occurred and the direction headed, as well as a bus # if possible? ^bd
all b52 buses are having this problem. i caught mine at greene &amp; washington at 1pm. no bus #. drivers say there's no route detour.
she isn't lying. you r being misled &amp; manipulated. sorry to hear, but trump will not help u or anyone but himself.
he is the most shallow frame of a person i have ever witnessed.
it's an expression i'm using on the hrc voters who are regretful. get it? i understand what happened.
haha. that assumes hrc supporters feel remorse 😂
should you pay for a fico score (it's expensive) when just starting to build credit?
no need to pay for credit scores - there are many free places to get it, including
and why do aa's care about trump admitting he think obama was born in us
bcause trump wanted to see his papers (transcripts &amp; bc which was already released) just like apartheid &amp; jim crow/slavery
never said ur point was wrong, just that reality shows only reflect our desire to see ratchness
one of my dream jobs is scripting/writing reality tv
if we all benefit from an opendata ecosystem who will pay (not should pay)?
who ever gets the service shall pay. we need it aggregated and service providers to be identified.
trump has spent years peddling a racist conspiracy aimed at undermining the first african american president. he can't just take it back.
obama is the first black president and the worst one we have ever had. he was probably radicalized when he was very young
trump for regulating porn. how is that pro-1a?
porn has nada to do w 1-a, more to do w pervs accessing young kids. can't always generalize🇺🇸🇺🇸

racism is hillary playing on emotions of black voters instead of offering them better proposals.

here's what's wrong w/ media coverage of trump. headline should be: trump issues false statement &amp; refuses to personally renounce birtherism
bingo ~ plain &amp; simple language everyone can really understand!!
the site or the tweet?
delete the meme. delete all the memes.
event masquerading as trump news conference on birtherism was ploy to get hotel coverage, days after he duped everyone into oz coverage
donald trump a huckster like william shatner trying to fill hotel rooms. trump using his his presidential campaign to do it.

pathetic is the best analysis of trumps flip flop.
this lies you just told
what lies babe? 😏
awh, but i 💗 !
i don't think it's fair to take the statement out of context.
how many? are they birthers too?
the original "birther was oscuma's literary agent. you fools are truly pathetic. lol!
when trump tries to deflect blame for denying that was born in america, he is lying.
hillary you are the one who is alwys trying to change the conversation..not trump

my point exactly. you'll pull her into conversation. again, but can't say methods are wrong. you support, u are
i have nothing to gain from a racist society. i support and treat all races with the respect they deserve. policy changes...
you actually have a ton to gain. without opening the same opportunities to all in the country the status quo remains

hillary’s chances in the forecast are below 60% for first time since july.
the unfortunate part is most people only watch the news, and, the media is paid off-by the clinton foundation.
so why did your man spread the birther rumor to me in 2008, asking us to investigate? remember?
she didn't do the birther. it was all trump
a possibly valuable resignation for turning attention to the fact that control of technology = control of policy.

why you going down this path - used to be a big admirer but it's going to be tough to respect you after all of this

wanting people to go through the process to be a legal resident is not racist.
no, but that's not the question of the racially freighted symbolism that trump started his campaign with.

wasn't doing enough on antisemetism a month ago. i realized it reading a step up tweet.
not a fan of the new home button on the iphone 7.
i'm a huge fan of it. feels just like force touch does on my rmnp.
oh i see that's how it should be 😂
lol like of course we gunna pay, but we appreciate you wanting to. makes us feel good. a small but important thing.
the un is reportedly to recognize yom kippur this year.
but do they think israel won or lost?
nephew hell
omg so cute💕💕
what mesmerism does heatherwick practice on rich men?
. and rich women too, to be fair.
hey this was the year i learned how to blog so
thnx horton!
today's the day i was finally like, i can't do this anymore, it's bad for my mental health, and unsubscribed.
like there's enough endless, breathless coverage of trump's bs that you def don't need it in your inbox every day too
the amount of people criticizing apple's iphone handing out process without knowing anything about it is very large
on the other hand apple not explaining this/understand their confusion probably has something to do with the slow-down in apple converts
way too many questions you must think i trust ya
be quiet tiny arms ;)
ikr i need it in my life at least some of the cheer cards gave us quality tum peeking out
i want them in crop tops and a skirt tho
wasn't sure. i knew you had a lot of tools
i don't subscribe either. :(
some things to try today on your new iphone 7: spin a picker wheel, scrub through a table view section index, pull to refresh...
. don’t forget switches. and then all the other lovely hidden haptics too!
needs to be always in teleprompter when he's without forget it getting trouble..and the media get crazyyyyyy destroy him.
yes, more discipline need to go into the weekend strong
lmfaooooooo no it has nothing to do with that i forgot about that but im fucking done he almost killed us
everyone almost killed us when we were tg

at least i've graduated up from fox news. aiming for the model of fairness in msnbc
just stay away from all tv. even wsj is more solid than anything on tv. i know u wont read waahington post.
ya it's super hard, but they can never stop you from standing up, but they can stop listening
i'm sorry i missed your keynote. couldn't afford to pay for an all-day github informercial.
i wish i took better photos, but i was distracted by all the beautiful women on set yesterday for
what you look beautiful hot ass hell &amp; sexy in this picture
harry reid: donald trump makes fun that i'm blind in one eye, but i still see "what an absolute fraud this man is"
blind in one eye and can't see a damn thing out of the other!
thank you! hope we can work on something together! 😊
we'd love to! if we're ever in the same country we should set something up
seconded! last two years at liu were tough. felt alone a lot, like nobody gaf. i ❤️ the new 🔥!
at the end of the day, uniting and working together makes success so much easier to achieve
we in "the media" have called trump a shithead in every way imaginable. repeatedly. at some point it's not on us.
if this had happend instead of press passing more bm,we'd b covering usa exposure2 new fraud like blockchain w/candidates or'08math
oh oh oh, was thinking airpods, ignore me
i also got confused.
i am just wondering where u got this notion of "rape" from, because it's not in your linked sources.
i see that the conclusion of "rape" is being drawn, but i see no fact of a 'rape' allegation.
greatest transformation ever goes to centereach kick line
thnak u sm !💙
days until red wings hockey. here he is with a hit on teemu selanne.
adirondack red wings represent!
i'm having a mercury retrograde life.
my moment isn’t actually bad, it’s just weird. an “old friend comes out of the woodwork” scenario
we're not disputing (at least i'm not) that repubs and trump took it to a different scale publicly and nationally
again, though, difference *of kind.* the clinton camp never implied there was secret damning information being hidden.
zero riffs and i heard he's from the north bay 😱😱
everyone asks me what's pacifica &amp; i'm like it's near san luis obispo? i don't fuckin know i live in fuckin qns
that's what everyone says
yeah you should be in class rn smh
don't worry it has a happy ending
i just threw my phone across the office. it's fine, screen didn't crack
ideal: election is about big ideas like campaign finance, police state politics &amp; gov't surveillance vs 4th amendment. reality:
i would give my left kidney to have that ideal election. policing, privacy, human rights, climate
an elected official telling us that pointing out racism is a "ridiculous narrative" and that it "doesn't matter".
&lt;&lt; parody
we in "the media" have called trump a shithead in every way imaginable. repeatedly. at some point it's not on us.
you're an exception, matt but when uses phrase "stretched the truth" for an instance of a blatant lie they're not candid
not bad for their first shot at that sort of thing, but doesn’t feel like parity with discovery weekly yet.
which is a little surprising given my use patterns. deep listening history available to apple, very shallow for spotify.
thank you for sharing your impact. great presentation .
thank you! 🙂🕊
anyone know how to create an ???
yes, we can certainly help you in developing your dream app. our pf ☞ email to ☞ leads.com
weirdly, my so-called "blog" also does not describe that as "rape."
it is a blog because you are describing her allegations as "rape". your descriptions = a blog.
her very last sentence, the one about 10 yo kids? so powerful.
yes, &lt;3: 10 yo boy she goes to school w be able to look at her &amp; say 'she can do whatever she wants'
just a kitchen island that i have no patience for
sure i'll build it
its a foregone conclusion muslim obama was born in kenya period!
corrupt meekswants tocontinue corruptionsw/ liar hill
trump has admitted falsehood about obama. i give rudy credit for pushing. hrc has been sick,but bither-ism has been sicker. 5 years of lies.
sure...and he blamed hillary! smh
can we still buy the full season package? i emailed you yesterday but never got a reply.
yes will be available when plays are ready. i'd like to know where my money is going first. will take care of email after
im off if you're in
i'm fucking in! that 7" is exclusive b-side
go from left to right. greater &gt; less less &lt; greater
why you quote tweeting this 2nd grader
again, though, difference *of kind.* the clinton camp never implied there was secret damning information being hidden.
framing facts (his father was kenyan) in shitty ways is not the same as making up frothy bullshit (he wasn't born here).
when you're driving south and see the first sign 🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻
noticed they added a "closed on sundays" on the highway sign! hahaha
love this song.
yeah, goes hard. one of my favs on the album.
not so fast buddy :-p the democrats started the birther issue ..in fact it began with the clinton campaign in 2007
jenny, i believe you are mistaken on this one:
my pants struggle to fit iphone 6 already tbh. my understanding is women's clothing doesn't prioritize pockets much, also
i carry a handbag or purse type of thing usually so as long as a phone fits in there i'm fine.
i just eat pussy other people need food
"i haven't eat pussy in like 4 years" - your words
i'm curious will the mission app come to ios? i'm really hankering to buy one but i'm not finding any info on this.
would you happen to know?
yes, and there is a full moon tonight! happy birthday to jack!
thanks :) yes, the moon was huge last night here.
most importantly, twitter finally proved they can monetize their logged out audience.
too bad it didn't help the bills win. :/
you're buggin i like it better than actual ice cream
chaaat that shit taste like flavored glue
lol! but pretty soon it's not going to mean much
agreed! people are already not taking it serious.. lol
dear apple, how am i suppose to tweet "if young metro don't trust you, imma shoot you" w. a fucking water gun?! 🔫
put the biscuit back!!!
because you're a racist race baiting hack
don't think trump and square pants look alike
ooh- iguana's and la vic's are literally a block from that picture if you like burritos. completely forgot about those spots
i would bathe in la vic orange sauce if i could. maybe i can snag a bottle before i move...😈
do bartenders not resent you for ordering worse things? i assume you tip like normal?
lots of people go to bars as designated drivers. tip as usual, if you want to get served as you usually do.
cries it's the outfits we need but don't deserve
its an outrage that only adonis gets all the sexy outfits. put the other boys in sexy outfits too pls he. actually kuro got some
so… has auth: it's exportable. implementation of export still in dev.

the best part is that i saw this live.
if real life was an rpg (it is) one of my passives would be "indiscernible race" because no one guesses my ethnicity right
i even have chinesies talkin chinese to me often
ahhhh. thank you, , for stating this.
this quote was all although i did edit it! :-)
i think carson is implying that he did not wake up and continue with his coffee and chocolate business
i wonder how quickly he could make $1.5 million dollars
expectations vs reality: lawrence edition
y'all look like the hofstra cast version of jersey shore. i think we need to start filming for the season primere
don't think it'll top the hotelier or 1975 for me, but we'll see. this shit is too heartbreaking to listen to at work.
pinegrove and modern baseball are up there for me too
racism is hillary playing on emotions of black voters instead of offering them better proposals.
. and now the delusional xenophobe is projecting too
since when did black stretchy chokers come back in style? i remember my sis sporting them in grammar school😂
those really thin ones, right? that kinda look like tattoos? i've seen a handful around, i remember 'em. 90s revival, babyyy
its an outrage that only adonis gets all the sexy outfits. put the other boys in sexy outfits too pls he. actually kuro got some
but still. i wanna see others in sexy outfits
at least he owns it
found your .gif
and people might get his name right too
inventor of autocorrect is the only person i'd gladly kill with no remorse.

congrats!! 🎉 i'll have to check it out!
no diversity in unreal spin from that campaign, at least.
obama birther issue isn't about race. it is about idiocy. trump's, that is!
keeps telling me i have an award to open when i don't. ghost award. my ocd going nuts :(
same problem, same ocd. that "1" really needs to go.
i wonder if they meant at "a berkley university" or something similar - the article does say "uc berkley"
uc berkeley is correct. "berkeley university" is not.
perhaps i should be a little more unavailable...
when people love you they want you around if they don't then you find someone who does because you are so worth it!!
the govt has issued officially recalled the galaxy note 7. at least 26 burns and 55 cases of property damage so far.

umbrella for shade tho!
i also dreamt i accidentally fed the dog some peanuts too..even tho the peanuts were labeled turtle peanuts. i felt so guilty
it got more wild omg. a nightmare
one more month and i can switch from sprint to t-mobile yes gaaaaawd
but like do i really wanna do this i'm having second thoughts
today's launch scrubbed due to hydrogen leak. i told you not to touch the rocket.
im sorry. just so shiny ✨.

that is not true. was not anyone related to the campaign. dumb ass
tony, we try to keep our threads issue based and without name calling. we are all friends here!

tr 290 departed late from alb. additional operational delays added to the disruption. we're sorry for the inconvenience.
only prob - the ticket window and the app told me it was "on time" oh well.
the fact that you think we don't remember it was you &amp; your campaign that started that racist mess. i can't w/ you.
but ummm, you started that.
loved the new stuff!!!!
😊❤️🎵🌹👍🏻xoac

you probably can guess which character dying hurt me the most ;_;
happy birthday pretty❤️❤️ love you and miss you💗💗
thanks rachel miss u too💖❌⭕️
everyone knows her record, president obama knows it. can disagree on policy, but trump is a racist. period
and he's a crappy businessman and human being
my model still shows him ending up with more pinocchios than electoral votes.
thank you for keeping this sh&amp;t show light ......
everyday i think about bein a sugar baby

painting of two-toned cats is latest decadence enjoyed among morally bankrupt and declining western upper class.
is that a sia cat?
isn't trump pissed at whoever tricked him into thinking obama isn't a citizen? i mean no one likes to look like a racist idiot.
fist larry king, now this!

i'll use it in a sentence. is a really racist racist who often practices racism. see. i didn't need the word .
you are far more racist than is or could ever be. oh, by the way, you're an idiot.
this is very sad...
it is. and 💯 true.
why conservative christians would have hated jesus
but vote trump.
maybe when a doc scopes the places from which trump gets his ideas it’s easier for him than other people who get colonoscopies. i doubt it
he has to fast for a day before. i loved it. man i felt so good. i do it again today.
my dad was born in poland. do you know how many people ever asked me whether or not i was born in america? nobody ever asked me that.

mommy, make her stop yelling.
she's a lunatic!
i'd ask the same about piccadilly circus 😹
agree entirely! worst
there is a rich history of both conservative and white liberals marginalizing us
it goes all the way back to garrison and frederick douglas
hope this story isn’t dropped. note: you fast, i think have to empty your bowels, are sedated, &amp; recovery takes hrs
once you wake up, you could tweet. but, you have to do it fasted in the morning.
lol boarding now
can i crash this party?
the most recent episode of , &amp; 's the weeds is maybe the best ever, you guys. it's fucking awesome.
it's not bad but it's no
mr. trump has finally put away hillary's movement. it's one less thing the media can use to distract us from !
. mr.donaldcunt is a delusional xenophobe who is now projecting needs a psychiatrist
not to jump in on ya thread but same thing happened for me how'd u fix it?
yeah i did that too and ended up getting it
i'll see bc i won't get it for another 6 weeks 🙄
fuuuuck😩 dude i'm praying that you go imagine how much fun that would be 😭
i used to go to mexico one a year for vacation &amp; the same thing happened to me. every morning he'd wake me up. every year😭
it's not a terrible way to wake up, tbh
i hope i keep my personality throughout the years

do not hate me for the monster we've become.
hating commences
all of you are going to think that 47 wiewers are bad, but am really happy with it😊
you have to start somewhere!
trump has admitted falsehood about obama. i give rudy credit for pushing. hrc has been sick,but bither-ism has been sicker. 5 years of lies.
"stupid is what stupid does"
aligned?!?! his campaign manager is the head of breitbart.
that's the code for letting his core know this was for idiot consumption only, not for the alt-right movement.
are fake bookings and acceptances still funny?
this isn't a subtweet! i was genuinely wondering/doubting? honestly no friends were harmed in the process
ios only? 😞
just start the ios sim, connect an app running in the sim to your mac app,
it’s on both for me
know if a lot of people are experiencing this?
and if you think hillary will be better you're out of you damn mind "literally"
anyone who calls himself hillbilly whoever doesn't indicate to me he has a clue about anything beyond the hollar.
“let’s reject the cynicism, the bullying, and the divisive rhetoric that my opponent is using to try and make us all afraid of each other.”
what basket did you stick the "divisive" rhetoric in?
so cool! are you lucky enough to live in sf?
i live in the south bay. i make occasional visits to the city when something is going on up there.

ghost award just opened. two of the same award? yeah, they mucked this up all around.
oh look, after a while a duplicate award appears. is this a conspiracy to drive us all mad?
a news study says taking makes you happier. in other news...most studies are bullsh*t. 😉
pretty lady !! keep taking pics😘🙏🐾🐾🐾🐾 save gods animals
the policy of airing a bunch of partisans arguing issues guarantees that there is no political penalty for lying or having bad policy.
who are you referring to?
omg. this lady is a walking conspiracy theorists spewing lies and misinformation.
where did this lunatic come from? she's scaring me. is she the president of the liars' club of america?
i admire your optimism, but a loss like that is demoralizing. could have been the killer to the season 😕
we were already supposed to be dead/ done post-trade deadline. so right now everything they've done since is gravy.
so kendrick does a verse on mmlp and suddenly he has strong em influence?
he always had one... all these new lyrical rappers do. i'm just saying it's easier to see with a side by side

all of this very thoughtful and perceptive, thanks. i've run into these phenomena too.

trump would be in the gulag for being a nazi. please use more accurate comparisons. or just don't do that at all.
huh? trump takes his lead from putin these days.

nah pop rollin on 22s skirtin on all these pill poppin "college students"
what a bunch of rubbish! hillary and her people have failed at failing, except for the failing part!
makes this shit up as she goes along. does she realize how dishonest and stupid she sounds?
or "here's what you've missed."
that one doesn't bother me so much bc like overnight or whatever, and it's still my timeline. but yeah, 😡
i know! i remember that only on the day itself! (and i have also wished her a happy birthday, with an in-person buss.)
my buss is always late.
donald trump's pants on fire claim that he 'finished' the obama birther talk
just because it get repeated again and again, doesn't make it so. name drop, mark penn

ufc 203 tomorrow night. time for the to get back on the championship path.
got this a little wrong.
is this not a scam?
yeah and it's being probed right they will be behind bars soon and we will be corruption free
its sad to see people take time out of there day to be mean to someone.
especially when they don't even know eachother🤔
is there or will there be a video of the talk?
eventually i believe so yes!!!
ugh, exactly the type of mistake i am all about.
in tandem with sad pierrot eyebrows and it's just like "break my heart already".
my husbands says... oh, fuck him. he's never dick-pic-ed me either.
that's just shameful! i dickpic weekly!!
trump would be in the gulag for being a nazi. please use more accurate comparisons. or just don't do that at all.
and frankly who cares? unless you're voting hrc you don't get to pretend to be a defense against trump
new poké bowl place in chinatown!!!
did you hear about one of those places that does jamaican food? poké, mon
same…but i don't use it in my cooking often…only for the table and when i'm making a spice blend that calls for it.
i used it in everything. i love pepper so much. i'm obsessed.
poll: 54% of voters believe that donald trump is more transparent than hillary clinton
assuming that people know what "transparent" means...
ugh sorry for all the typos. going too fast today. but does that make sense? twitter tl algo has a lot of variables, paid or not
even if i grabbed the link it'd likely be expired "sorry doesn't exist" since ads are usually run for short periods based on budget
i've given it a try. does this look correct for hacker news?
it does look correct
i’ll bring some appetite. you got food recommendations?
you like chicken? if so then two words "bon chon". you better ask somebody lolz /cc
is the picture fake? you no is not is a true picture and a fact

every since my surgery i get them checked once a year. it's a good practice!!
donald trump looks at women and decides how their looks rate on a scale of one to 10.
every red blooded man does exactly that.. where we differ from bill is we don't rape so there's that
thank you! 😊😊 dude i cut them myself 😂😂 but i made sure they weren't too short in case i didn't like them lol
they look good on you though! might need to hire you to cut mine 😂
please retweet. thanks for the help. -vj
trump has hurt so many people. you have to be smarter than this! shame on you! he;s raped a girl too. trump univ. wake up
of course, on some level, ppl right that some voices matter more... not coincidence no station in front of schumer's house :)
and, more can and should be done by city to flyer/poster in neighborhoods when large changes on the table.
it goes all the way back to garrison and frederick douglas

but local good governance work is thankless, and nearly all complainers only show up when something doesn't suit them
are you sure? i dont believe on my eyes.
which part ?
i walked in the store to pick up my merchandise, he's behind the counter chatting it up. i interjected like "i'm here to pick up."
he says "next time, you say excuse me." i said pardon?! it ain't gone be a next time and i don't need to say shit, can i get what's mine?!
which brand!?
simply protein
even if i grabbed the link it'd likely be expired "sorry doesn't exist" since ads are usually run for short periods based on budget

initially it did, but after a while it was processed smoothly
hmm mine still shows that. thanks! what format did you upload?
trump just mocked harry reid’s eye injury. reid’s response is perfect - democratic underground
except trump did that in response to reids absurd comments on the floor. angry old man.

but local good governance work is thankless, and nearly all complainers only show up when something doesn't suit them
and people are hardly ever equipped to say "you know, while i did nothing to help, others worked hard to negotiate this..."
he says "next time, you say excuse me." i said pardon?! it ain't gone be a next time and i don't need to say shit, can i get what's mine?!

bored, drunk, and lonely lol
you sound like an old lady
had my first one a couple days ago at phoenix bakery and kinda liked it.
i wonder if this is true. pretty disturbing if so!

i like the way it looks as a finishing ingredient…but it can get bitter when cooked on high heat or for extended cook times.

why does obama golf w/rich white men &amp; push "racism"? i'm so confused 😢
honey, because poor black men don't play golf. it's the demographics of the sport... bad comeback though 😘😘
and people are hardly ever equipped to say "you know, while i did nothing to help, others worked hard to negotiate this..."
"... and while my community is benefiting and i didn't have to lift a finger, i'd prefer some changes to the process"
chip no one has all the answers we all know that. trump is pushing against all the politicians who have used hardworking people
and then he stiffs them out of their hard earned pay. nice.
not really 😂
then idk what to tell you .
harry reid goes off on donald trump: "what a liar!"
harry reid is a joke! just an angry old man nobody wants to hear or listen to! sounded like a child with all those insults.

i'm not sure twitter is a healthy choice for me anymore. was it ever? once, the positives outweighed the negatives. do they still?
i struggle with this myself, and only you know the right choice. but there are folks here for whom your words are a world.
some doctors are no good 😭
wat happened sis ? is everything alright?
.... which one should i go with? need advice.
i _like_ apple’s upgrade program, because i find service providers annoying to deal with, but the plan…
i have work i need to do and all i wanna do is eat snacks and watch cartoons right now
you just need a job eating snacks and watching cartoons.
interestingly, clinton foundation dealings in haiti getting a lot of criticism/accusations from trump supporters here in miami.
yes, we are very surprised that buzzfeed does not report the haiti scam of the clinton foundation!

never forget how drunk everyone was
adam wasn't drunk.

richard u run a company if u had a team member making false accusations abt another dev the public would hold u accountable
i agree! leaders should purge inappropriate behavior on their teams, and lead by example.
why does obama golf w/rich white men &amp; push "racism"? i'm so confused 😢
if he liked to play basketball, you'd see maybe more black people, but then he'd be racist against whites for that
i'm sure this has been pointed out many times already but...the bills give up 37 and score 31 and rex fires his offensive coordinator?
because the offense calls so bad that couldn't score enough to let me give up points
i think it's time for the big t shirt and nike shorts uniform to die and some self expression and individuality to shine ☄️

does someone have a .mp3 of feist performing "secret heart" solo/acoustic? need it for, like, my health
i actually might. i have to check my external at home. that was my era yo! i saw her at columbus circle borders lol
also jenni what lip color you wearing
it's nyx!!! it's very orange i like it a lot, you can try mine if you want!
...all of which spout lies and they lap it up. i worry we are well and truly fucked. pardon my language.
sure we r all f'd up- that is the human condition but truth/lie right/wrong -- not really gray
i _like_ apple’s upgrade program, because i find service providers annoying to deal with, but the plan…
isn’t materially better. if verizon is offering a better monetary offer, it’s a better offer ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
this shouldn't have to be said: you don’t just get to say someone else did the worst things you’ve done. it doesn’t work. no one buys it.
plouffe said in 2008 that the clinton camp first floated the picture of obama in traditional african garb. own it!
the dc icons flash chain lighting comes with a treadmill!
you mean this? =d
you are hoping for kejriwalji's arrest in this particular scam. besharam party. how blatantly misusing public money. shame!
yeah i do .. because he is the source of this political corruption and he need to be behind bars for ram raj oops modi raj
i think it's time for the big t shirt and nike shorts uniform to die and some self expression and individuality to shine ☄️
now is the time for adidas pants
not sure who it was who predicted daesh-flag-inspired streetwear about 6 months ago but i guess they were correct so well done

it's not just the day of, it's the day before when you have to empty your bowels.

i totally agree he should have let it go and believe me i don't want him as pres but i dont want hills supreme court picks
fair enough!
because of course you did
never trust folks who overuse exclamation marks or ellipses
we've already had this discussion, kolsky, and we disagreed on some points. do you think kap's protest has lost mojo?
i'm not totally sure what you mean by that. i think his cause is worthy of protest.

yes glenna, very surprised that the 's at the clintonnewsnetwork do not discuss this.

a delay program for is no longer in effect
he will be depressed knowing he could have beaten trump handily.
i'm sure he was devastated about the when we always knew they were cheating.
hmmmm. i wonder if apple uses history for bought music, or if it started over from scratch?
good question. i never purchased much through itunes. my 10-year itunes listening history is mostly ripped library/apple music.
never forget: trump led a racist lynch mob &amp; got 5 youths wrongfully convicted in the centralpark jogger case. they spent 6-13yrs in prison!
to this day, trump has not apologized to the central park five. he still thinks they are guilty.
love your service, there are some inconsistency between when you say something will be delivered and when it actually arrives.
i bought a camera saying it will be delivered on the 15th, usps says it won't arrive until the 19th
don't really object to claim trump ended birtherism. certainly played big part…
u shld be ashamed of yourself for pretending to "objectively" report on this clown. he's a fascist on verge of destroying country

firstly i am a scholar well know with in the academia ! and i give talks around the world and at meant uni's
yea, that can be seen by your barren tl.
agreed. he brings too much drama to teams. he'll pop up as a d-coord somewhere
yeah i could see him as a dc. rob ryan, on the other hand, should be selling hot dogs in the stands.
carlos slim's personal bloggers are chasing the hot stories!
- omg maggie, i guess he is unqualified to be president. did someone drop you on your head as a child! or are you that stupid.
a6 retirees underestimate the value of rewards. those points can make big difference on fixed budget!

it's just not attactive on her
you're seriously missing out
he would come in to cogans and follow me around waiting for money to fall out of my pockets
firstly i am a scholar well know with in the academia ! and i give talks around the world and at meant uni's
firstly you are a proven liar, so your words are meaningless.
man if only was here rn i would've gone to visit her, im in her city rn 😪
😭😭😭 i miss my little city and you!
everyone's like "make a youtube channel with make up" but i'd probably be drunk and cussing the entire time so
if you make one i'll make one and we can collab
i'm very offended by the good in your morning. 😂😂😂
i'm going to need that in the form of a hashtag. 😅😅
the court ruling was referring to language in the ballot measure arguments, not their misleading ads ☹️
that's unfortunate. do voters even read measure arguments? they do see the onslaught of mail, tv and social ads tho.
i don't like mac millers album, but i like that track with anderson
that shit fire lol you wild
i can't wait until good and smart people have their time freed up from having to chase down the lies and corruptions of donald trump
me too, . media claims an enthusiasm gap for hillary—no, it's that we're exhausted by trump's act&amp;media's inability to cover it.
between this and 's offer, someone could make some real money.
cuban is a distraction and not worth a response
the sad thing is your response shows me your defeat and you are unable to respond to the verses i presented
anyone can see i did respond. keep trying lying imam.
we have ordered ours in the uk coming start of october
you will love it!
...where did the colonials and their minions flee to after the brutalized, oppressed masses had enough---west coast no/so america
(2)...same outdated mandate about ---hijack their gods and forbid them weapons still holds true in the sado/demented minds in usa
i've had so many people ask me to get them the new iphone. my answer is no, you can wait in the line like everyone else.
i'm shocked people actually want the new iphone.
good question. i never purchased much through itunes. my 10-year itunes listening history is mostly ripped library/apple music.
and a long period of very light itunes use during the rdio years 😢
if you can remain a member, i hope you do. and i hope together we can make it a better, safer community.
one of the lows: me using the wrong "it's."
love your service, there are some inconsistency between when you say something will be delivered and when it actually arrives.
i also bought a lens. you said it would be delivered by the 20th and it arrived today! which is great but the expectation is off.
not so cool if you're poor and don't have a smart phone. and need a phone.
actually they provide free wifi as well as terminals in the base to call and access the internet.
the sad thing is your response shows me your defeat and you are unable to respond to the verses i presented
the only way for you to defeat me is to kill me. i am in ny fake ass muslim.
😂😂😂 i swear. when you get famous i can say we sang together 😅
lmao. jude, who is this gentleman please? he's brought me alot of joy this afternoon.

yeah, still a very nice looking figure though. i like the dctv version as well.

the birther lie is what turned trump from an ordinary reality tv star into a political figure. that origin story can't be unwritten.

welcome to the party, jackie!
why would you consider dev patel to be a supporting actor and not the lead actor in lion? it's a big enough role.
i'll have to check it out then
yesss! it's a must
i didn't mean it wasn't worthy, but (outside of other players), it just seems like part of the luster of it has faded.
perhaps. by the way, look at how grown up we can be - disagreeing without insults!!
nah he just a didn't want you to call the cops

oh my gosh, amazing! i'm excited to meet in person!
now i have to come up with some good video ideas like what happens to my brain when i watch a video.
this is so dramatic to me
this is cool though
exclusive: hillary clinton campaign systematically overcharging poorest donors
is her own worst enemy. when she loses on nov. 8th to mr. trump she will have no one to blame but herself.
grey gargoyle (anything he touches turns to stone,) dreadknight (cyber knight,) whirlwind (all in the name) &amp; yeah overkill
speaking of, though not an iron man villain meet- overtkill (yes that's his name, yes it's 1 word)

hi, i really fell in love with your character tsf could follow me all the love for you 💘
you're sweet! upton sends all the love back! ❤
why would you consider dev patel to be a supporting actor and not the lead actor in lion? it's a big enough role.
and in any case there is no other lead male actor in lion no?
kawakami and jt the brick should co-host a radio show. we'll see who kills the other first.
i read kawakami's tweets, and didn't know if he was talking about jt, or fitz
most importantly, twitter finally proved they can monetize their logged out audience.
i'd argue they showed a fundamental misunderstanding of their own live platform vs. streaming sports and the inherent lag

we in "the media" have called trump a shithead in every way imaginable. repeatedly. at some point it's not on us.
matt respectfully. it's not about calling shit it's about killing his ability to control news cycle with shit he doesn't believe
love, respect, and trust are the most important aspects of all relationships
respects a two way street. i guess you visit london and just drive one way-only on the left side!!!
antiislamists are against islam in general. lets be fair here
islam is a plague on humanity.
of course. btw would i have been better to direct order? i though amazon might be quick. but i bet i don't see 'em 4 a while.
depends on when you ordered on amazon. i know that from it ships in two weeks…

modiji is doing great effort. i appreciate tht. i dont judge person based on success &amp; failure. efforts matters most for me.
ohh cool glad to hear that.. and how do you get to know efforts?
i once turned down group ride invite because they were too fast. her response: "how will you get faster?" me: "i don't want to."
it was incomprehensible that i could do long rides on a road bike and not have getting faster as a goal.
i love you.

i must learn the names on . i can't keep calling them, "faggy, broken bird, cute shoes, and the one with the lisp."

kanigher made a habit of creating really interesting women versions of masculine archetypes in his writing

i just want her to learn something from this, to quote professor tyra banks.
but she didn’t go through her grandma getting her lights turned off to buy her a bathing suit…
i agree there are muslims who hate jews and there are jews who hate muslims.

yeah, definitely is. but many festival/holiday foods are pretty unhealthy. like the treats during hindu festivals.
yeah, i think the taste isn't that great to justify. it's always an honor to receive, but in pure eating, maybe 1 will suffice

david brock offers money for info damaging trump
things are pretty bad when you have to advertise for it. what a baffoon.

also eastern promises
that's ... i dunno. is it creepy or sweet?
way creepy.
beyond disappointed at customer service and their sincere lack of commitment to their buyers/sellers. i've never been more enraged.

reason number 107 as to why i don't have a bf
initial reports indicate us special ops forces in tell abyad syria put up us flag to show identity as they came under fire: us officials
it's a bs. the us just habitually lies.
that's the problem with idealism though. some human beings will always behave aggressively and won't adopt such a system.
that is why police are so important, and why they exist in (nearly) every society. not everyone respects life or liberty.

here's 2 year old data - looks nowhere near as complete, but damn. didn't know ko was *that* slow
benchmarks like those are sometimes skewed in favor of one lib (lies, damned lies, and statistics)
see crash, babel and spotlight. when you have a big ensemble and no one with a realistic shot at lead, everyone goes supporting.
understand. let's see what they weinsteins plan. dev was certainly very strong in the film. his best acting work so far.
that is why police are so important, and why they exist in (nearly) every society. not everyone respects life or liberty.
people (should) use police when the nap is broken by someone.
mt : anyone got any photos of obama showing love for the troops? i haven't seen any in 8 years!
or any pictures of trump not disrespecting war hero john mccain.
islam is not the reason for extremism. extremists are the reason for extremism
so you do not see child marriages, lashings, and crucifixions, as acts of extremism.
hey ariel of the atlantic 👸🏾

lmaoo i saw surgical and coordinator and all i saw was 💰
to be clear, trump spent five years riding a racist lie into natl politics. today he admitted the lie. and the race is basically even.
so? maybe reporters need to start looking into the racism &amp; misogyny as to why she is even.
wow. thanks for the picture share. an oldie but a goodie. really a trip down memory lane.
fyi that picture was taken today. your sign really says that!
thanks for the rt
easy to rt - fantastic sketches!
hillary calls on trump 2apologize for his birther remarks. will she apologize 4 her staff spreading that rumor when she ran vs obama in '08?
you're a lying piece of shit!
columbia students: the band is problematic fuck them also columbia students: i love st a's

we're six days into the regular season and the buffalo bills already have the look of a trainwreck.
in other words, nothing's changed in the past 16 years.
people (should) use police when the nap is broken by someone.
i would also say it extends to be the purpose of the 2nd amendment of the us constitution.
we'll find out more tonight when they play lb poly. but my oc sources, whatever that's worth, say this team is loaded.

those waterproof tests are quite impressive. helps support the decision to remove the headphone jack.

two things: 1 protest supposed to make ppl uncomfortable. 2 no need to speculate on his message - he stated it clearly w/words.

trump's own tweets show the medical report of his having a colonoscopy on a certain date is... a lie.
from experience, the procedure is min. 4 hrs downtime. late night dr? prob not, wld have leaked by now.
and cnn continues to protect obama/hillary and lie about syria!!!
this is disgraceful and cnn gets away with these lies.
the fraternal order of police just endorsed donald trump

now that trump has shared his physical results on "dr. oz," what's next? how about his tax returns on "shark tank?"
kind of sad that he demand birth certificate from black man while white man won't give us his tax returns
once again, an uneducated and childish response. typical of a loser.
true hurts, huh? ahmadis spread islam and then other muslims kill them. useful idiots.

islam will never be defeated. unless you intend to kill a muslims, which you probably do.

try this media / reporters / networks / cable "news" announce a complete &amp; total shut down of trump coverage until taxes released
yes! no more coverage until he releases tax returns. he uses media 2 his own advantage. now media can return favor.

the birther movement was about delegitimizing the first african-american president in our history.
talk to hillary about it.
4 hours later i'm setting up my phone now. turns out it doesn't come with ios 10.0.1 so i have to wait for that to install now.
and it failed to install the first time 😂 luckily for apple i'm already familiar with how broken everything is. imagine a new customer…
i don't think he does—otherwise skipping meds would surely be a part of his self-harming behavior
which we hear so much about in so much detail
😂 busy show today
he hung right up the second i finished
only trump can fix this
to the rescue, and i'm not even a customer -yet:
"oh, ain't you a beautiful girl" *mumbles w/o looking up* "i am a harpy from hell and i will eat your heart out, go away"
i love walking to work. i can write emails and blog posts and exercise and release excess aggression in a socially approved manner
i am super excited about cathartic reunion, no lie
i would be except i'm not a red mage so i'm terrified instead :p
thanopocalypse &amp; modjoker? or is that just regular modok?
that's just what modok looks like, the other guy's the controller
: practically, multiple implementations. rhetorically, standards &amp; joint stewardship.
i can (theoretically) use a webapp on any platform that has a web browser, and in any web browser i want.
once again, the 'disbeliever' in this context, are the jews who sought to kill jesus. not all non muslims
it is pure hatred that still exists today.
if mizzou beats georgia i'll give everyone who rts this $20
can i trade that 20 for a mizzou loss in east hartford next year?
the video is cringeworthy
is it not just highlights?
link is rerouted to same page. is this event still open? i want to register. thanks!
we recommend calling the store!
not stubborn, just tenacious. essay will find happy home. i know this to be true!!
tenacious! that's a much better word!
sharing our coffee location in about 30 minutes on instagram. come hang.
niggas got work smh
big day for big fans like me. first speaking with at event, now giving first speech for .
can't believe actually showing speech. napping?
at least in egypt christians have freedom to worship. unlike for muslims in angola
the coptics are persecuted there.
that's a lot of money spent 😂
yes, and i earned all of it
thank you for sharing your story . keep training and having fun.
niantic has spoken !

terrific. btw, i'm a humble fellow of that fine organization (escph)
does ontology recapitulate ontogeny?
fell asleep before midnight last week and didn't get to preorder my iphone 7. putting gum in my headphone jack to simulate the experience.
check out instead.
at least in egypt christians have freedom to worship. unlike for muslims in angola
too bad. islam is cancer and should be banned.
not really our right to know what's in his tax returns if he does not want to release them...
he has made this an issue - even his running mate released taxes - he is hiding something
when u find ur cuban fam on facebook lmaoo we still outchea 🇨🇺🇨🇺🇨🇺
so my great grandmother was born in cuba in which she had her kids there, then migrated to jamaica
michigan poll: leads 38% to 35%.
not for long. depolorables will be heard.
happy ! it's time for boris!
from mad when i was around 7:
there is no harambe-associated story. this is straight-up racist garbage. at a pub run by trump campaign manager.
this year is the worst
it's as if they are looking to say 'haven't you seen a cat talking to a cow before!!!' 😂😂😂
they are saying "don't bother us, we are having a private talk"!
mad jewish ppl checkin their cars as i'm standing next to them 🙄🙄
lmao yea white people in the bx aren't in the 21st century. we apologize in advance
frasier's dad was the best character on the show
john mahoney. he was amazing as martin. he was in "in the line of fire" which is the best.
yes true, but so have the muslims burma been persecuted for centuries.
islam should be oppressed.
it was not true when trump floated it 2011. or 2012. or 2014. none of it was ever true. unwinding the "birther" lie:
why obama never showed his college records? student visa?
i am super excited about cathartic reunion, no lie
(alternatively i may just become a red mage with some sort of chandra/depala/vehicles fury road/fast &amp; furious deck)
the was the best place for a young journalist to work. everyone there is brilliant. this is an awful day.

be right there homie
i think i can live with small frequent events that affect a group of books instead of these larger events
it's all so disruptive, like i dropped anad wolverine &amp; totally awesome hulk cause of event shenanigans
a snippet of some of the mad conversation going on today...
there is a whole lotta comfort talking 'bout food.yet you covered the gamut: music, photos, bikes &amp; your charities via wff:)
i'm now possibly too excited for this movie.
it's pretty much a remake of the original but i think it gets by on how like...relentless it is haha
ugh you're so cute💗 glad everything is going well for you!🎉
thanks kel! keeping up with you on the miss ca teen snap today 💘
i just answered 3/10 questions on the physics test that i spent time studying with strangers for yesterday.. happy friday

iphone 7 case steal! grab a rose gold iphone 7 case for $3 w/ code: qra2tpy5
what about 7plus cases
i agree mark is a smart man but he is not political smart he is computer smart i have many friends like that
. what would you call trump's smarts?
they didn't bother cleaning the carpets?
here's hoping they're spending their money on delivering world peace instead?
shame anyone truly loving india would never compare our elected pm with a paki terrorist! yes
time to offer this asshole to his allha,instead of goat.the meat should be given to pigs.
sure hillary started . it's why obama made her secretary of state. are we even trying anymore or is everyone too tired?
well he is not known for making the best decisions.
honestly i apologize for ever saying shit about kylie. i know what it feels like to hate the way i look. that pressure to assimilate sucks.
it sucks a lot when the world tells you over and over that you're not beautiful enough or good enough the way you are.
sonnen: i'm on a legends ass kicking tour. i hope they book two guys for my debut because i know one will pull out.
lulz. who cuts a promo better than this dude?
really? i wanted it to be good.
it wasn't as good as i was hoping it would be. the first one is definitely a lot better
the fraternal order of police just endorsed donald trump
...(2) does this fraternal order of masons---uh we police have a sister fraternal order branch.?
lmao...a long needed saga reference.
saga is the best!
no it's a breakdown explaining how beautiful it is like one of those facebook politics videos
well they certainly know how to target their audience
that makes no sense! tanio are not native americans. what?!
they are tho there ameriindian from the americas taino were in north america as well
the new enstars single covers are gorgeous and i am trembling in fear. will my heart stop beating for real when fine's come out?
when fine's cover is revealed ... it's over
my stomach is cramping help
go to the doctor?
i guess i'm used to the later, slightly less creepy modok designs. does the controller control things?
people, he has special disks that go on the back of your neck that lets him mind control you
83-year-old schaffer's tavern closing to make way for... a bank, of course
could be worse. could've been a duane reade or a starbucks.
that makes no sense! tanio are not native americans. what?!
the tribes intermingled
hillary did not disclose that she did not send classified emails however we now know she lied...
exactly. she was investigated. still an issue. does not mean trump is not hiding something in
matters where you take the test, not live. app will ask you where you are, so you can do it while traveling
ever get a chance to give it a whirl? feedback?
whoa thats like two blocksfrom my apartment
do you come here all the time? please say yes.
hillary the birther that he was from kenya was started by obamas own publicist way back. research and look it up!
hillary's campaign started it. all her acolytes were pushing it here in nyc in '08
it sucks a lot when the world tells you over and over that you're not beautiful enough or good enough the way you are.
we gotta start loving ourselves. accepting ourselves for who we are and accepting others for who they are. 💯
you guys, i'm about to tightline my eyes which i learned 20 minutes ago was a makeup technique and not a way to do drugs
i love just the way you are. miss krall sings it beautifully.
trying to elevate hrc by ignoring her numerous flaws "because, trump!" is one of the main reasons why she's in this predicament.
hrc has no more flaws than any other politician and far more positives. trump on the other hand is a nasty farce.
"it could be worse" i'd also an officially blacklisted term
i've got a bad feeling about this
flying out of sfo this morning to oklahoma, saw lots of texas fans were arriving for their game at cal.
under appreciated venue and absolutely beautiful campus. with 'horns playing well, this should be a pleasant trip.
all it has to do is be better than book of shadows, so i figure it's got a shot. i was the perfect age when 1 came out.
oh yeah. it's a great continuation of the story.
hey there's a big ol' pit by my apt in and all i can think of is"i fell in the pit"

trump was born 1936 (not '46) in munich, germany to an ss officer &amp; biergarten waitress...'cause, you know, whatever.
i think the orange cheeto &amp; his followers would be ok with that 😉
instead of campaigning for hillary, maybe president obama should, oh, i don't know, do his job?
mixed on that. the more he works, the more usa is screwed.
he went to find u a nuse
lmao have u ever been at those villages, where the women carry wood on the shoulder i want one of those
whoo hoo! not sure i could handle two of her but it's worth trying ;)

trump spewed racial hate for yrs insisting obama was an african but not an american. he ignited the fire of hate we will now have to put out
if u r able to listen&amp;read, it's hrc that keeps bringing up the birther issue.she has nothing to say.
this is what i'm concerned about
we can see snowden instead
regarding birtherism, it’s not over til the candidate himself allows himself to acknowledge that obama was born in hawaii.

you could generalize that to people, not just men. have seen both ways, but absolutely fair given situation.
i know. personally, iver never experienced a woman elbow me out of the way or tell me what to do. only men.
happy birthday brother🙏
thank you brother !
the trump rally in miami is like a 5 minute walk from me. do i fill water balloons with pee and peg attendees with them?
i'm not saying you should do that, but i'm not going to say don't do that.
seems like a decent villain. expecting him in a movie never.
he's a great fit for something marvel never does in their movies- a villain organizational team
i am actually both. native &amp; pr... and it is not the same just like the maya &amp; aztec are not the same. but whatever.
tainos got as far as georgia where artifacts were found
wip real talk tho, are there things that aren’t snakes that come out of skulls?
this is dope
“let’s reject the cynicism, the bullying, and the divisive rhetoric that my opponent is using to try and make us all afraid of each other.”
that's deplorable!!
he needs to apologize not just to but to his family, especially sasha and malia.
fuck that! hillary started it and he finally got bho to release his birth cert.
just asked if he was going to now apologize to . he dodged my question twice.
art of the deal ... and you got dealt!
spent 25 mins trying to say something funny about my app being next to 's face-moji. comedy is hard 😂
"now i'm wishing i made our logo my face"
just kinda weird that he's not here anymore?? i still keep expecting this tiny little asshole to try and eat my dinner
ah... i'm so very sorry. it sounds like things were rough and you did everything you could *big snugs* if you need anything -
he's a great fit for something marvel never does in their movies- a villain organizational team
something with 1 lead bad guy but several super villain lieutenants making up their entourage
"when it comes to the qualifications we should demand in a president...we need someone who’s going to take this job seriously.” —
one of the first requirement is tax returns,he has artfully avoided,his base is racist,they just don't want t bother
"he nurtured the conspiracy like a poisonous flower, watering and feeding it..."
not everyone can be an upright, moral, forthright person like you, katy. some of us are racist, bigoted, misogynistic xenophobes
what donald trump has said about our president is really, deeply, disgraceful. where is his apology??
so why doesn't anyone call him out?! certainly didn't.
i have very mixed feelings about american horror story 6... what do you think?
the new style is interesting, but why are the "dramatization" actors 10ish years older than their interviewed counterparts?
in other words he wants child marriages and sex slavery legalized in america. islam is a mental disease.
thanks mate!
where's the snap? 💀💀💀
its on my instagram! i'll post a flash back friday later 😂

oh… i just got to that song.
now imagine that it opens to the babybabybabybaby part and you do weakness things to enemies to kill them in 10 seconds
this turned out to not be a joke.
i’m cringing following your saga, it makes me very unhappy :(
the new style is interesting, but why are the "dramatization" actors 10ish years older than their interviewed counterparts?
i feel like that has to be significant, somehow.
annnnnd we're back at it!
man! that's a good looking cart! quite the improvement!
playin skidmore tonight and i am not bashful
yo my best friend goes to school there! he will be in attendance - his first time seeing you
it’s dry af here bro
the humidity is like 80% in daly city. it's probably cancer. i probably have eye cancer.
i can never quit this job because my resume would have to say "cat retriever" and "disposer of mice".
"supervisor of vermin-control employees"
his trauma is a real thing that speaks to queer people. we're lucky if we haven't experienced abuse
tbh most of my problems with jude's character/storyline are *because of* my experiences with abuse &amp; mental illness
i can't believe the worst candidate ever with no ground game and tv ads might just win the elec.
it's fantasy. realitytv. not going to happen.
yay i thought so, thank u
late to the party but i agree with the result
a great recap of os transformation journey i was lucky to be helping with (from my good friend )
i'm the lucky one!
now imagine that it opens to the babybabybabybaby part and you do weakness things to enemies to kill them in 10 seconds
and then, you start a new fight and you get the babybabybabybaby opening again and then you do weakness things to enemies to--
wtf does this have to do with trump.
she's running against him and wants to maintain the separation of church and state. relevant.
us friends, we can now finally ship from our online shop to you (well almost all of you). more details here
thank you!!
you could generalize that to people, not just men. have seen both ways, but absolutely fair given situation.
i have had women ask if i'm actually in line. and i've done that. it's the insistence that bugs me.
just asked if he was going to now apologize to . he dodged my question twice.
what a great penetrating question. you must have a very high iq
just kinda weird that he's not here anymore?? i still keep expecting this tiny little asshole to try and eat my dinner
i just lost my baby earlier in the year, i am happy to talk. i am so sorry 😥💖💖💖
i'm starting to think could just be making stuff up and photoshopping it now, and we'd never know.
those are real - they are "common" in a part of brazil.
so glad i contributed in a small way to making this happen—it's the most beautiful mag i've seen in a long time!
i am thankful to for bringing me in!
there's like 30 people here and none of them want to interact with each other.
there is also three dudes who look like jeff rosenstock but are totally not jeff rosenstock.
i wonder who did so wrong, i'm sure her ex on twitter stressin 👀
all my exes are dead
an overview of the move &amp; some initial thoughts. more coming.
fyi the tweet in that post just shows up as broken html
follow he has link on his account. read from top to bottom from her side and rose side of the story.
i just read his article but i can’t find the texts you screenshotted, that’s what i really want to see

thanks for the share niklas! keep up the great stuff you're doing with blinkist. 👊🏽
to be fair i'm the same way. i got that self check bone. no cashiers in my way. i'm my own cashier
self checkout all the way. especially with the "forgot my card," option. all the deals, none of the tape.
and then, you start a new fight and you get the babybabybabybaby opening again and then you do weakness things to enemies to--
kill them in 10 seconds, and then run on to the next enemies to fight them and get that glass shattering into babybabybabybaby
deffo gonna break a sweat to this one! thanks for your suggestions❤️ lm hq x
definitely going to listen to it when i'm on the subway so i can bop my head up and down.people'll say i'm crazy
stfu carnage i'll drop kick you in the neck
i'll dropkick you in the chest.
if do remember reading when hillary releases her goldman sachs transcripts he will release them....
she's already released her taxes - why hasn't he? then we'll deal with transcripts.
people really out here getting pick up orders from in order to fedex them overnight to friends.
the little food truck that could...
he´s a fantastic director 👍😘
i agree❤️😀👍
trump is a genius!!! he got the media to broadcast the opening of his brand new luxury hotel in d.c. 😂😂😂😂 awesome👍
what's odd is how msm doesn't talk of . claim that dt is racist seems to get watered down if he is brought up.
tbh most of my problems with jude's character/storyline are *because of* my experiences with abuse &amp; mental illness
i don't think the book is w/o merit—but its insistence that jude is not mentally ill is very suspect to me...
dammit, jews! luckily it’s yom kippur this week…you can beg for forgiveness.
should probably remind all my new followers that i too am a member of the tribe.
bs that was so forgivable, her opponent asked her to be his secretary of state. she's a fine, nay, great candidate.
she is way behind what she should be; i think it's debatable if that's for reasons she controls.
yeah. about that...
well if they some how turn this thing around then it won't have gone wrong after all
i'm close to snapping at someone today everyone i've dealt with has been super snarky and i have just about had enough with the nice klee
no, do not abandon nice klee, do you want to let them win? i wouldn't, always stay true to yourself and don't let anyone change you
no way, come to the city!
when can i?

i know, its been great (more or less) whenever i’ve done it. so disappointing. :-/ on a lighter note, me you and …
speaking as an outsider looking in, the whole reason they're fighting is incredibly stupid.
carol's all "i want to be the douche bag this event!" &amp; tony's like "well, i saw minority report so deal!" -let them fight-

should get together sometime soon! its been wayyyyyyy too long!
false translation.. word used is "curse" not "destruction"
says you which means nothing. either way it is hatred.
then there was this---&gt; donald trump's birther pr stunt beset by chaos, stage collapse
my god. he's more vile &amp; evil than i thought. will really have to rethink if i can't support a lying corrupt panderer after all
yeah and the words under god by a presidential candidate sure help.
they're irrelevant "civic religion." what matters is your commitment to the 1st amendment where she's rock-solid.
who will i be seeing at this weekend?!
you should go check out panel.
clinton goes on tweetstorm ripping into trump:
its called a frustrated temper tantrum there r so many important things to discuss why this? what is hrc covering up
you know that feeling when you thought your tweet was funny but it completely bombed? well that was pretty much my high school years.
, my high school years were like... h/t:
.: "in these final days let's try to tune out all the chatter and the non-stop analysis."
he is the 1st mixed potus. mom was white &amp; she raise him. dad was black &amp; he left both of them!
white people. we gotta have a talk with marc jacobs. whose turn is it this time?
whatever for? he just stated that i was guilty of cultural appropriation when i straightened my hair.....
the acculumated anti-clinton narrative built up since 90s is shitty...but the truth is not "she's actually great!"
i wouldn't say "she's actually great!" so much as this may be closer than expected, in which case factors like this may have impact
so like the masters of evil, or the sinister six.
more like masters of evil yeah, like for im4 they could do one big bad like mandarin and give him several super henchmen
false translation.. word used is "curse" not "destruction"
i know, you the unknown muslim is cited more than sahih international. lol
trying to block career services emails but it turns out there are like five different addresses that they use so i keep! getting them!
i am employed please leave me alone
is it out yet?
closed alpha. a friend got me in
let's laugh at this person while ignoring the lack of critical faculties we bring to the politicians we favor.
you seem to be mistaking my wracking sobs for laughter.
more like masters of evil yeah, like for im4 they could do one big bad like mandarin and give him several super henchmen
like controller or blizzard don't really work as solo villains but they're dope supporting villains
michelle obama: "a candidate is not going to suddenly change once they get into office"
yes we know that already... nothing changed in the past 8 years... cause the promise of change was a lie.. so you are right
ok over this convo cool. not going back &amp; forth.
as hispanic we def shud embrace that cultural background
this is tafseer not translation.
which outweighs anything you have to say on islam. who cites you?
i do not want these emails look at me i am the captain now
bottom text
your assuming he is,her investigation was because of breaking the law, he is not breaking the law by not releasing
again: why won't he release ?
the acculumated anti-clinton narrative built up since 90s is shitty...but the truth is not "she's actually great!"
i don't think sander's would have pursued so rigorous and flimsy a critique if he thought race would be close, for example.
i wonder if any talk show hosts rubbed hitler's hair?
yeah, but they were all on the radio so you couldn’t tell.
i also have cop friends who say they deal w/ the same people all the time doing the same things, yet the public isn't aware of it
there's no doubt that being a good policeman/woman is one of the hardest jobs in the world.
trump is a genius!!! he got the media to broadcast the opening of his brand new luxury hotel in d.c. 😂😂😂😂 awesome👍
then there's relationship with clinton/ al sharpton... no bigotry there. absolutely ridiculous.
how that happen
someone let unloaded a clip smh lmaoooooooo dique . some bs bro all my fault smh
i'll accept my fate when the time comes, please give all my money to scientists so they can cure eichi's illness...

the cost of living is more expensive for the poor
there's a nice video on about this summarizing how expensive it is to be poor.
"should be" is an interesting phrase. there's no precedent for a woman running for president.
"should be" is based on generic/avg dem candidate with name recognition; i added "in her control" in part bc sexism
white people. we gotta have a talk with marc jacobs. whose turn is it this time?
i mean instead of just hiring these models, he went to a fucking etsy store to buy yarn!!!!
jude is mentally ill, how can you not be mentally ill when you're the unwilling participant in an adults sexuality?
i agree—but there's a part where andy tells willem jude isn't bc his behavior makes sense in reaction to his trauma
wang referenced ghesquiere a ton during his time at balenciaga. literally copied things.

remember when they said the macbook air would flop or that the ipad would never be practical?
it'd be nice if they were like secret service-esque pods that sit in your ear with no extremities
then there's relationship with clinton/ al sharpton... no bigotry there. absolutely ridiculous.
but shut it down. a political move going down in history as pure brilliance.
"should be" is an interesting phrase. there's no precedent for a woman running for president.
but also in part because of racist fervor trump has tapped into, etc
i once dissected a sheep eye, i’m qualified to help.

sadly, those chains are the lies we tell ourselves as perceived truths
no one here will tell, will they? 😀
i won't lol!!
nope. fuck this. i need a new job. idc if anybody feels some type of way about it.
you and me both 😒
these are the people we are dealing with, they don't even know where obama was born.
lol. trump literally tweeted a link that says obama was gay-married in a muslim ceremony.
it's now forever settled: is a lying racist piece of garbage.
how's that rape trial going mr.trump?

i'm really afraid that it will be too sad for me

no problem, we are just so happy for all the love and support 😊❤
"the presidency doesn’t change who you are. it reveals who you are. and the same thing is true of a presidential campaign." —
yes it does and sadly we know who hillary is.
i guess racism, lies, con jobs, and rape, just aren't funny. did have to resort to trump to boost ratings? sad :(
fallon had the most corrupt and dangerous person to run for potus over to…muss his hair unbelievable
we're excited for you! best of luck with the move, and come see us for a treat when you're all settled in?
of course, i look forward to it!
i hope everyone has an amazing time at ! sad i can't be there but i miss all of you 💋❤️

i had problems with his proposals and rhetoric...but laying the blame on his campaign for people not getting behind her..
i think it's too soon to say. but i think it's plausible his rhetoric may impact outcome, don't you?
you're my height right
how tall are you?
under god is "civic religion" ? lol
yeah, it's meaningless. it's like "in god we trust on the money." compared to defending the separation of church and state?
remember when they said the macbook air would flop or that the ipad would never be practical?
my guess is that they settled with a suboptimal design not because they wanted to look like regular headphones but bc of the mic

i'm so in love with can you follow me? lots of love xx
glad to hear you love , we're so happy about all the love we've seen today ❤ sure thing 😊
let's see if trump dares to attack the first lady today. you may want to watch his twitter feed.
that would have a big downside because women do love her and that could mobilize the base. doesn't mean he won't though.
lol you really are butt hurt aren't you. did some muslim kid beat you up when you were a kid ?
i have no respect for you at all, so nothing you say will get under my skin.

this is ridiculous! curry is one of the best, if not the best shooters ever in the game.
there's no mystery what links all these. birtherism is the symptom, not the diagnosis. 4/4
when you don't understand trade or economic, don't know much history, what else do you have to talk about?
experimenting with sleep schedule and it turns out maybe the reason i'm so tired 24/7 is bc i only feel rested after 12hrs of sleep minimum
which is an issue because more than 6 hours is.. unrealistic for my current work/class schedule

in march, have to plan early though
crazy that in a month my beautiful friend will be marrying her soulmate💕 ugh 😍
i love you sm my tee 💗
how about this, reporters at trumpmania: when he claims credit for proving potus born here (or whatever) how about all of you just laugh?
preferably hysterically.
i'm blushing
never mind. no edits necessary. that shreve guy is a good egg.
this guy really likes wawa.
that person is correct
gop underestimated the makeup of their party and ignorance within

there is, try volume down + power
yeah, definitely is. but many festival/holiday foods are pretty unhealthy. like the treats during hindu festivals.
admittedly my family re-gifts them. like fruitcake!
a week ago on i successfully pushed giuliani to say that trump believes president obama is legitimate. today, trump admitted it.
kind of. while proffering a different lie...
i do enjoy villain teams, so i'd be down for that.
it'd be a great way to spice things up too from the standard chatty villain, big ticking clock, sky thing, homogenous henchmen
lol you really are butt hurt aren't you. did some muslim kid beat you up when you were a kid ?
deflection. you were talking trash this morning about taking over america. back it up muslim.
son!!!!! lmaooooo i peep marie shit she ain't low!!!!
those tips pull through. she think she lower than my balls? nope.
more trump: -muslim san bernardino neighbors saw "pipe bombs" -innuendo on cruz/carson/clinton/romney faith 3/x

surely is our instagram
thanks. i’ll take a look shortly. so sorry for the issues you’re seeing.

after trump non-ambiguously says obama born in usa, press essentially vows to chase trump to gates of hell over birther issue.
as well we should, . he didn’t apologize, he lied in blaming it on clinton, and he should answer for that.

what's really galling is that today, once again, donald trump used a racist conspiracy theory to boost his political and personal fortunes.
but he failed! just like he will fail to become president. 😬
furman also talks about algorithms as a form of hard-to-detect price fixing.
these will be reviewed before seizure &amp; "free" will be everything.
donald trump admits the president is an american

for some reason they're angry that trump believes obama was born in america.
media is so hysterical that people can't believe this is who we rely on for information.
the difference is wouldn't do this.
no way, hell would freeze over for him to do it. darkside took shots, phil said nothing

i didn't really sleep well last night.
marc jacobs has been added to the never ending list of ignorant trash
what a fucking idiot
it's about remaining "sane" for the next 7 weeks. this time everyone has made up their minds, so no point to convince others
i'll bring back again &amp; again how donald is embellishing his "brand". classic marketing! emotions are like free advertising
but that means he bought one of the jerseys. a little confusing; better to just ignore, no?
maybe he had the jersey &amp; decided to put it to good use.
peeps get all worked up when they see a flock of these.

people who put 'all opinions my own' in their twitter bio: is this a mandate from your company? if not, what prompts you to put it there?
differentiating between "this is coming from the company" and "this is coming from me". i'm often mistaken as marketing.

thanks connor!

but it *is* friday, so let's celebrate!
yea every other saturday😩

cool! i’ve had my eye on this one.

it'll go to his fave charity, "the trump foundation."
we live in times when those who were supposed to be 4th pillars of democracy are the ones weakening it.
there are creative ways to oppose him and voice your anger. resorting to this hashtag shows clear lack of sense and class in u.

then they claim your violating their free speech, because thats how free speech works.
