# Simple-Lightweight-Chatbot
This is a simple lightweighted chatbot that is capable to perform services based on the confidence level and threshold value given!

The chatbot perform well based on the datasets given only. It is not universal like an AI chatbot. This bot can be used as a simple greeting chatbot or a professiocal service chatbot that helps customers to solve easy problems!!!

P.S. The dataset for this chatbot must be in a reasonable size only. Do not provide too much data as it will eventually be confused on what it is going to reply given a input statement!
